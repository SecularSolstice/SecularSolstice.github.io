<h1 id="how-to-add-to-this-website">How to Add to this Website</h1>
<h2 id="general-principles">General Principles</h2>
<p>This website is hosted <a href="https://github.com/SecularSolstice/SecularSolstice.github.io/">on a github repository</a>. In addition to robust, ad-free hosting, this gets us version tracking, history, collaboration and branching/merging support.</p>
<p>This is as close to a bag of files as I could get it while still being a viable website. All the HTML is auto-generated using makefiles. Most of the content is in markdown. Hopefully this will make it pretty easy to modify things and to bring things into formats not-yet-conceived while also making things pretty.</p>
<p>Cloning your own git repo is recommended, as that will make the autogeneration go much more smoothly. If that’s not practical, you can use github’s web interface and ask someone else to run <code>make all</code>.</p>
<p>Programs used in the autogen scripts include lilypond, timidity, lame, pandoc, wkhtmltoimage and python. Future developments are likely to include wkhtmltopdf, LaTeX, abc2ly, imagemagick and ffmpeg. All of these are available through apt or non-debian equivalents.</p>
<p>There are a few cases where make’s dependency detection won’t work. If this seems to be happening, delete and remake the relevant files.</p>
<p>When in doubt, copy something already here.</p>
<h2 id="github-advice">GitHub Advice</h2>
<p>If you’ve used Github before, you can probably ignore this section. Just remember that not everyone is, so don’t do anything really sophisticated with branches anywhere that anyone else will need to look at it.</p>
<p>To do almost anything with Github, you need an account. Go to <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and sign up. Giving them your email is safe: they won’t spam you. Don’t worry about the features you could pay for: you won’t need any of them.</p>
<p>The most proper way to contribute content is a “pull request”, a bundle of proposed changes. To do this, you must first create a “fork”, a copy of the project under your own username, still on Github. This may seem inelegantly heavyweight, but it’s very little actual effort, and puts very little burden on the servers. Just go to the <a href="https://github.com/SecularSolstice/SecularSolstice.github.io">main project page</a> and click “fork”.</p>
<p>Now you have your own copy of everything. You can do whatever you want here and it won’t effect the main repository at all.</p>
<p>There are (at least) two ways to make changes. One is through the web interface. There are “Create a new file” and “Upload files” buttons, and when you view a file, there’s a button with an icon of a pencil to edit it. Note that every change you make this way is a separate commit (a commit is the fundamental unit of changing things in git) and needs a message. A one line explanation of what you did will suffice. Note that all the auto-generation scripts won’t work this way, but that’s not a big deal.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can clone the repository unto your local computer. If you click the “Clone or download” button, you’ll get a URL. Go to your command line and type <code>git clone ${THAT_URL}</code>. You’ll now have a third copy of everything, this time on your own computer. Make the changes using your favorite tools, <code>git add</code> any files you create, <code>git commit</code> everything, and then <code>git push</code> it all back to your copy on github.</p>
<p>There are lots of guides to git on the internet. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/">This one</a> seems pretty good.</p>
<p>Once you’ve made your changes, send a pull request back to the main repository. Github’s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/">own documentation</a> takes you through the process. If you’re not sure you did things right, just mention your concerns in the pull request message.</p>
<h2 id="if-thats-still-too-much">If That’s Still Too Much</h2>
<p>Git can be a lot to take on, depending on your background. If you want to contribute but don’t want to deal with all this, send your content to either Ruthan Freese (rcfreese [at] gmail [dot] com) who has volunteered to be “official Github intermediary” or to Daniel Speyer (dspeyer [at] gmail [dot] com) who set this whole thing up. Try to get your content as close to the forms used here as is easy, but don’t sweat it.</p>
<h2 id="want-push-access">Want Push Access?</h2>
<p>If you think you should have permissions to push straight here without going through a pull request, you’re probably right. Contact Daniel Speyer and remind him who you are. Make sure to mention your Github username.</p>
<p>(If you don’t know what this means, don’t worry, it doesn’t affect you.)</p>
<h2 id="what-belongs-here">What Belongs Here?</h2>
<p>If it’s been used at a Solstice or was written for Solstice, it belongs here. If it was neither, but seems really good, that belongs here too. Songs that seem only kind of relevant probably don’t belong here, unless there’s some specific reason to include them, or you really want to.</p>
<p>Putting things here imposes very few costs. Unless you’re thinking of adding so much that a list becomes unreadable, go ahead. And if you are, then consider putting these things into a separate list.</p>
<p>For songs used at Solstice, but not written for it and easy to find elsewhere, I sometimes created stubs. For example, <a href="/Imagine/gen">John Lennon’s Imagine</a>. This enables including the song in setlists, but doesn’t take much effort or get in anyone’s way. When I do this, I <em>don’t</em> include them in the All Songs list, to avoid cluttering that with links to pointless pages.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-song">Adding a Song</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a directory for it and a <code>gen/</code> subdirectory</li>
<li>Create a <code>README.md</code> file, starting with the title as a level-1 header and the attribution and summary as level 2.</li>
<li>Create a canonical representation of the song. If a chord chart, call it <code>chart.csv</code>. If Lilypond, call it <code>sheet-music.ly</code>.</li>
<li>Create a <code>Makefile</code>. This must define the <code>PREFIX</code> and <code>FILES_TO_LIST</code> variables, provide a rule for <code>gen/${PREFIX}lyrics.txt</code> and include <code>../scripts/Makefile.common</code>. It may also provide rules for other files (such as the voice-only sheet music for Voicing of Fear). Note that the simple conversions are provided for you, but the lyrics are not because there’s too much variation (but helpful scripts are provided).</li>
<li>Add any other files you want to make available.</li>
<li>Run <code>make all</code></li>
<li>Add the song to the All Songs list in the appropriate place and to any other relevant lists.</li>
<li>Run <code>make all</code> on the lists as well.</li>
<li>Check that everything looks correct</li>
<li>Add everything to git, including the generated files</li>
<li>Commit and push</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-a-speech">Adding a Speech</h2>
<ul>
<li>Put it in the speeches directory in markdown format</li>
<li>Begin with the title as a level-1 header and the author as a level-2</li>
<li>Add it to the All Speeches lists and any other relevant lists</li>
<li>Run <code>make all</code> on first the speeches and then the lists</li>
<li>Check that everything looks correct</li>
<li>Add everything to git, including the generated files</li>
<li>Commit and push</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-a-list">Adding a List</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a file in the lists/ directory. Use # marks for headers. For speeches and songs, use the file/directory name, not the formatted title.
<ul>
<li>You may wish to use the <a href="../list_building.html">list builder</a> for this. It offers autocompletion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The name of your file should have underscores for spaces, but the capitalization you want to display. Also, lists will be alphabetized on the main page, so name accordingly (if this becomes a problem, alter the create-main-index.sh script).</li>
<li>Run <code>make all</code> in both the lists directory and the root.</li>
<li>Check that everything looks correct</li>
<li>Add everything, including the generated files</li>
<li>Commit and push</li>
</ul>
