<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Dusty tome, lies forgotten<br>
Cover worn, pages rotten<br>
A curious book<br>
I’ll just take a look<br>
Checking out the Necronomicon<br>
<br>
Creepy words, pages turnin’<br>
As your brain, is a churnin’<br>
Insidious memes<br>
Infecting your dreams<br>
Haunted by the Necronomicon<br>
<br>
In the graveyard I can make a promise.<br>
That is not dead which eternal lies,<br>
Soon I’ll reunite with brother Thomas!<br>
(For with) strange aeons even death may die…<br>
<br>
More I’ve read, the more I’m listenin’<br>
In my head, voices whisperin’...<br>
‘Tonight is the night’,<br>
‘The stars are all right’,<br>
Time to use the Necronomicon<br>
<br>
In the graveyard we could raise an army,<br>
Send it out to ravage all the land...<br>
Sure, the thought may seem a bit alarming,<br>
(But if you) read the book, I swear you’ll understand!<br>
<br>
Later on, we’ll conspire<br>
As we dream by the fire<br>
To face unafraid<br>
The plans that we made<br>
Studying the Necronomicon<br>
