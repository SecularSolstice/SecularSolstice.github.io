#  Time Wrote the Rocks
## By Cat Faber
## Truth is found in the world

This song was originally "God Wrote the Rocks", contrasting with
"Humans wrote the bible".  It was changed because the goal of the
rationalist project is not to find flaws in religious fundamentalists
and laugh at them, but to find flaws in ourselves and fix them.
Thinking of irrationality as "that thing biblical literalists do" will
make it *harder* to recognize in ourselves.
