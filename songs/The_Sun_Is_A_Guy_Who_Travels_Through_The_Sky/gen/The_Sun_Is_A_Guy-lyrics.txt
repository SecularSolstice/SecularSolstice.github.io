The sun is a guy who travels through the sky,
in a great big chariot of fire.
It’s getting pretty dark, looking like he might depart,
Leaving nothing but an everlasting night.

The sun is bright, but quite a spiteful
Jerk sometimes we’ve found,
But if we sacrifice some goats
Mayhap he’ll come back ‘round.

We need his light
We need his heat
We need his energy,
Without the sun, without a doubt
There’d be no you and me.
The sun is a guy who travels through the sky,

in a great big chariot of fire.
It’s getting pretty dark, looking like he might depart,
Leaving nothing but an everlasting night.
