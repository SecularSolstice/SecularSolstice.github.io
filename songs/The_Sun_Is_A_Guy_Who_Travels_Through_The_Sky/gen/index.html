<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
The sun is a guy who travels through the sky,<br>
in a great big chariot of fire.<br>
It’s getting pretty dark, looking like he might depart,<br>
Leaving nothing but an everlasting night.<br>
<br>
The sun is bright, but quite a spiteful<br>
Jerk sometimes we’ve found,<br>
But if we sacrifice some goats<br>
Mayhap he’ll come back ‘round.<br>
<br>
We need his light<br>
We need his heat<br>
We need his energy,<br>
Without the sun, without a doubt<br>
There’d be no you and me.<br>
The sun is a guy who travels through the sky,<br>
<br>
in a great big chariot of fire.<br>
It’s getting pretty dark, looking like he might depart,<br>
Leaving nothing but an everlasting night.<br>
</p>
