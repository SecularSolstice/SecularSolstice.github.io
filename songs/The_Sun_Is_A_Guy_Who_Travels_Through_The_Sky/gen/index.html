<p>To the tune of <a href="../../The_Sun_Is_A_Mass_Of_Incandescent_Gas/gen">The Sun Is A Mass Of Incandescent Gas</a>.</p>
<p>An MP3 <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2018/02--why-did-the-sun-shine.mp3">recording from Boston 2018</a> is avaialable.</p>
<p>This songs has been facetiously introduced as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In honor of the ancient people who awaited the return of the sun, I want to start by singing an ancient hymn to the sun god, maybe one of the same hymns that they sung around their stone circles five thousand and twelve years ago. The tune is taken from a recovered pre-Druidic chant, but if by some chance you happen to know it anyway, sing along.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
The sun is a guy who travels through the sky,<br>
in a great big chariot of fire.<br>
It’s getting pretty dark, looking like he might depart,<br>
Leaving nothing but an everlasting night.<br>
<br>
The sun is bright, but quite a spiteful<br>
Jerk sometimes we’ve found,<br>
But if we sacrifice some goats<br>
Mayhap he’ll come back ‘round.<br>
<br>
We need his light<br>
We need his heat<br>
We need his energy,<br>
Without the sun, without a doubt<br>
There’d be no you and me.<br>
The sun is a guy who travels through the sky,<br>
<br>
in a great big chariot of fire.<br>
It’s getting pretty dark, looking like he might depart,<br>
Leaving nothing but an everlasting night.<br>
</p>
