We wish you a Scary Solstice
We wish you a Scary Solstice
We wish you a Scary Solstice
And an eldritch New Year!

Weird cravings we bring
To you and your kin
Weird cravings for Solstice
And an eldritch New Year!

O bring us an icky pudding
O bring us an icky pudding
O bring us an icky pudding
Bereft of good cheer

We won't go unless it's loathsome
We won't go unless it's loathsome
We won't go unless it's loathsome
And dripping with fear

We wish you a Scary Solstice
We wish you a Scary Solstice
We wish you a Scary Solstice
And an eldritch New Year!
