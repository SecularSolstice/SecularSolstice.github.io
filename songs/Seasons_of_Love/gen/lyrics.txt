 Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear 
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes 
 How do you measure, measure a year? 
 In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee 
 In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife 
 In five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes 
 How do you measure a year in the life 
How about love.... How about love? 
How about love.... How about love? 
Measure in love.... Measure in love.
Measure in love.... ...Sea...sons... of
 love.... lo-o-ove... seasons of
 love.... lo-o-ove... 
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes 
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan 
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes 
 How do you measure the life of a woman or a man? 
 In truths that she learned, or in times that he cried? 
 In bridges he burned, or the way that she died 
 It's time now to sing out, tho' the story never ends 
 Let's celebrate, remember a year in the life of friends 
Remember the love.... Remember the love
Remember the love.... Remember the love
Measure in love.... Measure in love.
Measure in love.... ...Sea...sons... of
 love.... lo-o-ove... seasons of
 love.... lo-o-ove...
