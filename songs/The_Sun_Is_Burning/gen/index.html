<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
The sun is burning in the sky,<br>
Strands of clouds go slowly drifting by,<br>
In the park the lazy breeze, Are joining in the flowers, among the trees,<br>
And the sun burns in the sky.<br>
<br>
Now the sun is in the West,<br>
Little kids go home to take their rest,<br>
And the couples in the park,<br>
Are holdin' hands and waitin' for the dark, And the sun is in the West.<br>
<br>
Now the sun is sinking low,<br>
Children playing know it's time to go,<br>
High above a spot appears,<br>
A little blossom blooms and then draws near,<br>
And the sun is sinking low.<br>
<br>
Now the sun has come to Earth,<br>
Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death,<br>
Death comes in a blinding flash,<br>
Of hellish heat and leaves a smear of ash,<br>
And the sun has come to Earth.<br>
<br>
Now the sun has disappeared,<br>
All is darkness, anger, pain and fear,<br>
Twisted, sightless wrecks of men,<br>
Go groping on their knees and cry in pain,<br>
And the sun has disappeared.<br>
</p>
