#  Forever Young
## By Bob Dylan and Joan Baez
## An outsider's blessing that verges on transhumanism

There are several melodies for this.  We use Joan Baez's.  You can
[hear her perform it on
youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4UoJ47SzjA).

The original first line is "May God bless and keep you always".  We've
done this as "May good fortune find you always" and "May you always
find good fortune".  The latter is more grammatical, and the inversion
is not really poetically appropriate, but the former fits the original
rhythm better.
