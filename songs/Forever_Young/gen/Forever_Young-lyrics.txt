May you always find good fortune
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you

May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay...
                    ....forever young


May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you

May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay...
                    ....forever young


Forever young...
Forever young...
May you stay...
                    ....forever young


May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift

May your heart always be joyful
And may your song always be sung
And may you stay...
                    ....forever young
(Repeat Chorus and Retardando at end)
