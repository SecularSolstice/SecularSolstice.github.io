# La Vie Bohème
## By Jonathan Larson (from RENT)
## A celebration of reckless fun

While the song itself is cheerful and energetic, many listeners will recognize it and know that the musical as a whole is darker.

In the original, there are dialogue segments interspersed with the music.  The lyrics as presented here remove those in a way that probably works.  I've also modified the opening to reference solstice instead of the in-plot funeral.

The sheet music here is also transposed down into a register that's more convenient for NYC, and has fewer sharps and flats than the original.  It's also annotated with singers: G is male, E is female and D is not to be trusted with complex music.  The original, of course, has more singers, so this was an attempt to collapse it to three.

[A recording of the original is on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5tuzq-uIVc), as are most likely many others.
