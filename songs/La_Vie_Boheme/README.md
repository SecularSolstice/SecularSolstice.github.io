# La Vie Bohème
## By Jonathan Larson (from RENT)
## A celebration of reckless fun

While the song itself is cheerful and energetic, many listeners will recognize it and know that the musical as a whole is darker.

In the original, there are dialogue segments interspersed with the music.  The lyrics as presented here remove those in a way that probably works.  I've also modified the opening from "On this night when we celebrate the birth / In that little town of Bethlehem" to "On this night when we celebrate rebirth / Of that little star we call our own", since that's what we're celebrating this night.  One could argue that the song starts earlier, but the earlier bits are too plot-linked and too full of Christian and Jewish references, so this seems like the place to start.
