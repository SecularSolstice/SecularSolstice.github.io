  [G] Here we sing
  For Whate'er it's worth
  On this blue green planet called mother earth
  On this night when we celebrate rebirth
  Of that yellow star we call our own
  We raise our glass, you bet your ass, to
  La vie Bohème

  To days of inspiration
  Playing hooky
  Making something out of nothing
  The need to express
  To communicate
  To going against the grain
  Going insane
  Going mad

  To loving tension, no pension
  To more than one dimension
  To starving for attention
  Hating convention
  Hating pretension
  Not to mention, of course
  Hating dear old Mom and Dad

  To riding your bike
  Midday past the three piece suits
  To fruits
  To no absolutes
  [E] To Absolut
  [G] To choice
  To The Village Voice
  To any passing fad

  To being an us, for once
  Instead of a them

  La vie Bohème

  [D] So that's five miso soup
  Four seaweed salad
  Three soy burger dinner
  Two tofu dog platter
  And one pasta with meatless balls
  And thirteen orders of fries
  Is that it here?

  [G&E] Wine and beer!

  [E] To hand crafted beers made in local breweries
  To yoga, to yogurt, to rice and beans and cheese
  To leather, to dildos, to curry vindaloo
  To huevos rancheros and Maya Angelou

  Emotion, devotion, to causing a commotion
  Creation, vacation

  [G] Mucho masturbation

  [E] Compassion, to fashion, to passion
  When it's new

  To Sontag
  To Sondheim
  To anything taboo
  [G] Ginsberg, Dylan, Cunningham, and Cage
  Lenny Bruce
  Langston Hughes
  [E] To the stage
  [G] To Uta
  To Buddha
  [E] Pablo Neruda, too

  [G&E] Why Dorothy and Toto went over the rainbow
  To blow off Auntie Em

  [All] La vie Bohème

  [E] Bisexuals, trisexuals, homo sapiens
  Carcinogens, hallucinogens, men
  Pee wee Herman
  German wine, turpentine, Gertrude Stein
  Antonioni, Bertolucci, Kurosawa
  Carmina Burana

  [G] To apathy, to entropy, to empathy, ecstasy
  [G&E] Vaclav Havel, The Sex Pistols, A B C
  [E] To no shame, never playing the Fame Game

  [G] To marijuana
  
  [E] To sodomy
  It's between God and me
  [All] To S and M

  La vie Bohème
  La vie Bohème
  La vie Bohème
