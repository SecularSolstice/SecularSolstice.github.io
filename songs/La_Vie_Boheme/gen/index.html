fun</h2>
<p>While the song itself is cheerful and energetic, many listeners will
recognize it and know that the musical as a whole is darker.</p>
<p>In the original, there are dialogue segments interspersed with the
music. The lyrics as presented here remove those in a way that probably
works. I’ve also modified the opening to reference solstice instead of
the in-plot funeral.</p>
<p>The sheet music here is also transposed down into a register that’s
more convenient for NYC, and has fewer sharps and flats than the
original. It’s also annotated with singers: G is male, E is female and D
is not to be trusted with complex music. The original, of course, has
more singers, so this was an attempt to collapse it to three.</p>
<p>[A recording of the original is on
youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5tuzq-uIVc], as are most
likely many others.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  [G] Here we sing<br>
  For Whate'er it's worth<br>
  On this blue green planet called mother earth<br>
  On this night when we celebrate rebirth<br>
  Of that yellow star we call our own<br>
  We raise our glass, you bet your ass, to<br>
  La vie Bohème<br>
<br>
  To days of inspiration<br>
  Playing hooky<br>
  Making something out of nothing<br>
  The need to express<br>
  To communicate<br>
  To going against the grain<br>
  Going insane<br>
  Going mad<br>
<br>
  To loving tension, no pension<br>
  To more than one dimension<br>
  To starving for attention<br>
  Hating convention<br>
  Hating pretension<br>
  Not to mention, of course<br>
  Hating dear old Mom and Dad<br>
<br>
  To riding your bike<br>
  Midday past the three piece suits<br>
  To fruits<br>
  To no absolutes<br>
  [E] To Absolut<br>
  [G] To choice<br>
  To The Village Voice<br>
  To any passing fad<br>
<br>
  To being an us, for once<br>
  Instead of a them<br>
<br>
  La vie Bohème<br>
<br>
  [D] So that's five miso soup<br>
  Four seaweed salad<br>
  Three soy burger dinner<br>
  Two tofu dog platter<br>
  And one pasta with meatless balls<br>
  And thirteen orders of fries<br>
  Is that it here?<br>
<br>
  [G&amp;E] Wine and beer!<br>
<br>
  [E] To hand crafted beers made in local breweries<br>
  To yoga, to yogurt, to rice and beans and cheese<br>
  To leather, to dildos, to curry vindaloo<br>
  To huevos rancheros and Maya Angelou<br>
<br>
  Emotion, devotion, to causing a commotion<br>
  Creation, vacation<br>
<br>
  Mucho masturbation<br>
<br>
  Compassion, to fashion, to passion<br>
  When it's new<br>
<br>
  To Sontag<br>
  To Sondheim<br>
  To anything taboo<br>
  [G] Ginsberg, Dylan, Cunningham, and Cage<br>
  Lenny Bruce<br>
  Langston Hughes<br>
  [E] To the stage<br>
  [G] To Uta<br>
  To Buddha<br>
  [E] Pablo Neruda, too<br>
<br>
  [G&amp;E] Why Dorothy and Toto went over the rainbow<br>
  To blow off Auntie Em<br>
<br>
  [All] La vie Bohème<br>
<br>
  [E] Bisexuals, trisexuals, homo sapiens<br>
  Carcinogens, hallucinogens, men<br>
  Pee wee Herman<br>
  German wine, turpentine, Gertrude Stein<br>
  Antonioni, Bertolucci, Kurosawa<br>
  Carmina Burana<br>
<br>
  [G] To apathy, to entropy, to empathy, ecstasy<br>
  [G&amp;E] Vaclav Havel, The Sex Pistols, A B C<br>
  [E] To no shame, never playing the Fame Game<br>
<br>
  [G] To marijuana<br>
<br>
  [E] To sodomy<br>
  It's between God and me<br>
  [All] To S and M<br>
<br>
  La vie Bohème<br>
