<p>While the song itself is cheerful and energetic, many listeners will
recognize it and know that the musical as a whole is darker.</p>
<p>In the original, there are dialogue segments interspersed with the
music. The lyrics as presented here remove those in a way that probably
works. I’ve also modified the opening from “On this night when we
celebrate the birth / In that little town of Bethlehem” to “On this
night when we celebrate rebirth / Of that little star we call our own”,
since that’s what we’re celebrating this night. One could argue that the
song starts earlier, but the earlier bits are too plot-linked and too
full of Christian and Jewish references, so this seems like the place to
start.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
On this night when we celebrate rebirth<br>
Of that little start we call our own<br>
We raise our glass, you bet your ass, to<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
<br>
To days of inspiration<br>
Playing hooky<br>
Making something out of nothing<br>
The need to express<br>
To communicate<br>
To going against the grain<br>
Going insane<br>
Going mad<br>
<br>
To loving tension, no pension<br>
To more than one dimension<br>
To starving for attention<br>
Hating convention<br>
Hating pretension<br>
Not to mention, of course<br>
Hating dear old Mom and Dad<br>
<br>
To riding your bike<br>
Midday past the three-piece suits<br>
To fruits<br>
To no absolutes<br>
To Absolut<br>
To choice<br>
To The Village Voice<br>
To any passing fad<br>
<br>
To being an us, for once<br>
Instead of a them<br>
<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
<br>
So that's five miso soup<br>
Four seaweed salad<br>
Three soy burger dinner<br>
Two tofu dog platter<br>
And one pasta with meatless balls<br>
And thirteen orders of fries<br>
Is that it here?<br>
<br>
Wine and beer!<br>
<br>
To hand-crafted beers made in local breweries<br>
To yoga, to yogurt, to rice and beans and cheese<br>
To leather, to dildos, to curry vindaloo<br>
To huevos rancheros and Maya Angelou<br>
<br>
Emotion, devotion, to causing a commotion<br>
Creation, vacation<br>
<br>
Mucho masturbation<br>
<br>
Compassion, to fashion, to passion<br>
When it's new<br>
<br>
To Sontag<br>
To Sondheim<br>
To anything taboo<br>
Ginsberg, Dylan, Cunningham, and Cage<br>
Lenny Bruce<br>
Langston Hughes<br>
To the stage<br>
To Uta<br>
To Buddha<br>
Pablo Neruda, too<br>
<br>
Why Dorothy and Toto went over the rainbow<br>
To blow off Auntie Em<br>
<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
<br>
Bisexuals, trisexuals, homo sapiens<br>
Carcinogens, hallucinogens, men<br>
Pee-wee Herman<br>
German wine, turpentine, Gertrude Stein<br>
Antonioni, Bertolucci, Kurosawa<br>
Carmina Burana<br>
<br>
To apathy, to entropy, to empathy, ecstasy<br>
Vaclav Havel, The Sex Pistols, 8BC<br>
To no shame, never playing the Fame Game<br>
<br>
To marijuana<br>
<br>
To sodomy<br>
It's between God and me<br>
To S &amp; M<br>
<br>
La vie Bohème<br>
