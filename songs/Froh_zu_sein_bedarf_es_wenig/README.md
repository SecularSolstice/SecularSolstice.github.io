#  Froh Zu Sein Bedarf Es Wenig

## It takes so little to be happy

A German children's song, traditionally sung as a round (the numbers in the lyrics indicate where the first singers should be when the *n*th group joins in).

An English translation that mostly scans would be:

> It takes little to be happy
> And who's happy is a ki-ing
