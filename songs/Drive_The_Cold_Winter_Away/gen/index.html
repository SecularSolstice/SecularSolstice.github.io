<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
All hail to the days that merit more praise<br>
Than all the rest of the year,<br>
And welcome the nights that double delights,<br>
As well for the poor as the peer!<br>
Good fortune attend each merry man's friend,<br>
That doth but the best that he may;<br>
Forgetting old wrongs, with carols and songs,<br>
To drive the cold winter away.<br>
<br>
This time of the year is spent in good cheer,<br>
And neighbors together do meet,<br>
To sit by the fire, with friendly desire,<br>
Each other in love to greet;<br>
Old grudges forgot, are put in the pot,<br>
All sorrows aside they lay,<br>
The old and the young do carol this song,<br>
To drive the cold winter away.<br>
<br>
When white-bearded frost hath threatened his worst,<br>
And fallen from branch and brier,<br>
Then time away calls, from husbandry halls<br>
And from the good countryman's fire,<br>
Together to go to plough and to sow,<br>
To get us both food and array;<br>
And thus will content the time we have spent<br>
To drive the cold winter away.<br>
