<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Worlds grow old and suns grow cold<br>
And death we never can doubt.<br>
Time's cold wind, wailing down the past,<br>
Reminds us that all flesh is grass<br>
And history's lamps blow out.<br>
<br>
But the Eagle has landed; tell your children when.<br>
Time won't drive us down to dust again.<br>
<br>
Cycles turn while the far stars burn,<br>
And people and planets age.<br>
Life's crown passes to younger lands,<br>
Time brushes dust of hope from his hands<br>
And turns another page.<br>
<br>
But the Eagle has landed; tell your children when.<br>
Time won't drive us down to dust again.<br>
<br>
But we who feel the weight of the wheel<br>
When winter falls over our world<br>
Can hope for tomorrow and raise our eyes<br>
To a silver moon in the opened skies<br>
And a single flag unfurled.<br>
<br>
But the Eagle has landed; tell your children when.<br>
Time won't drive us down to dust again.<br>
<br>
We know well what Life can tell:<br>
If you would not perish, then grow.<br>
And today our fragile flesh and steel<br>
Have laid our hands on a vaster wheel<br>
With all of the stars to know<br>
<br>
That the Eagle has landed; tell your children when.<br>
Time won't drive us down to dust again.<br>
<br>
From all who tried out of history's tide,<br>
Salute for the team that won.<br>
And the old Earth smiles at her children's reach,<br>
The wave that carried us up the beach<br>
To reach for the shining sun.<br>
<br>
For the Eagle has landed; tell your children when.<br>
Time won't drive us down to dust again<br>
