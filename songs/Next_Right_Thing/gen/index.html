<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
# Verse 1<br>
I've seen dark before, but not like this<br>
This is cold. This is empty. This is numb.<br>
The life I knew is over. The lights are out.<br>
Hello darkness, I'm ready to succumb.<br>
<br>
# Verse 2<br>
I follow you around I always have.<br>
But you've gone to a place I cannot find<br>
This grief has a gravity, it pulls me down<br>
But a tiny voice whispers in my mind:<br>
You are lost, hope is gone<br>
But you must go on<br>
And do the next right thing<br>
<br>
# Verse 3<br>
Can there be a day beyond this night?<br>
I don't know anymore what is true<br>
I can't find my direction, I'm all alone<br>
The only star that guided me was you.<br>
How to rise from the floor<br>
When it's not you I'm rising for?<br>
Just do the next right thing<br>
Take a step, step again<br>
It is all that I can to do<br>
The next right thing<br>
<br>
# Bridge<br>
I won't look too far ahead<br>
It's too much for me to take<br>
But break it down to this next breath<br>
This next step<br>
This next choice is one that I can make<br>
<br>
# Verse 4<br>
So I'll walk through this night<br>
Stumbling blindly toward the light<br>
And do the next right thing<br>
And with the dawn, what comes then?<br>
When it's clear that everything will never be the same again<br>
Then I'll make the choice to hear that voice<br>
And do the next right thing<br>
</p>
