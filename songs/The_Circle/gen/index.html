<p>If you’re not familiar with the idea of Moral Circle Expansion,
Michael Aird of Rethink Priorities has written <a
href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M2gBGYWEQDnrPt6nb/moral-circles-degrees-dimensions-visuals">a
good primer on it</a>.</p>
<p>This can be done as call-and-response, with a leader singing the
first and subsequent odd-numbered lines.</p>
<p>Note that “far ones” here refers to people in distant lands, not
Lovecraftian horrors, though some people hearing it may think the
latter.</p>
<p>A version of this song <a
href="https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/the-circle-scratch-recording">is
on bandcamp</a></p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Raise a song, and so commence<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
in praise of all Benevolence!<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
Once a cold and silent night<br>
did the loveless stars pervade;<br>
yet we here, of star-stuff made,<br>
cast a circle of warmer Light!<br>
<br>
Circle, circle, grow and grow.<br>
<br>
So will we bring our families in,<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
those whom Nature made our kin?<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
Countless likenesses we find,<br>
by our common blood bestowed.<br>
What a debt of care is owed;<br>
what a blesséd tie that binds!<br>
<br>
Circle, circle, grow and grow.<br>
<br>
And will we bring our neighbors in,<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
our expansion to begin?<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
Bounty of the harvest sun,<br>
shelter from all hazards dire,<br>
share with each, as each require,<br>
doing as you would be done.<br>
<br>
Circle, circle, grow and grow.<br>
<br>
And will we bring the stranger in,<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
every state and speech and skin?<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
Think upon the mystery:<br>
how alike is Humankind!<br>
Tho' manifold in face and mind,<br>
conspecific sisters we!<br>
<br>
Circle, circle, grow and grow.<br>
<br>
And will we bring the far ones in,<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
all who distant-born have been?<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
For the hands you'll never hold,<br>
for the names you'll never learn,<br>
for all far-off hearts that yearn,<br>
let compassion boundless roll!<br>
<br>
Circle, circle, grow and grow.<br>
<br>
And will we bring all creatures in,<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
feather, fur, or silicon?<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
Though their unseen thought beguile —<br>
strange the substrate they employ —<br>
all who suffer or enjoy<br>
are brother soul, in body wild.<br>
<br>
Circle, circle, grow and grow.<br>
<br>
And will we bring the future in?<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
All of time is ours to win!<br>
Circle, grow and grow.<br>
Will our children rise in power?<br>
overwhelm the starry deep?<br>
Lights unborn, for you we keep<br>
will and hope, though dark the hour.<br>
<br>
Circle, circle, grow and grow.<br>
