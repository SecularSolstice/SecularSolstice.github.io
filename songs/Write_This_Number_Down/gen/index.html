celebration of justice and rule of law</h2>
<p>In the Morning and Light arcs, we’ve got a bunch of songs about the
present being better than the past, and the possibility of the future
being better still. Mostly, they’re about technology, and knowledge, and
prosperity. This is a song about the world becoming more just and
compassionate.</p>
<p>The number in the title has a potentially-confusing double meaning:
In the first verse, “Write this number down, you can call it anytime”,
it’s a phone number one might call to ask for help - e.g. the National
Lawyer’s Guild’s “I was arrested for peaceful protest” hotline number
(1-212-679-6018). At the end of the song, “there’s millions of us there
to get your backs […] write this number down” the same phrase recurs,
seemingly referring to the number of people willing to help - “it’s
growing all the time”.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Write this number down, you can call it anytime<br>
We have been waiting for the day that you would finally drop the dime<br>
<br>
I praise the ones who persevere in seeking justice through the law.<br>
I caution there were those who felt abandoned and betrayed by what they saw.<br>
Some stood in halls of silence,<br>
With icy hints of violence<br>
When they did seek justice through the law.<br>
<br>
I'm witness to the commons and the institutions of the People's rule<br>
The parents take their kids to local parks and then their kids head off to school<br>
You might see the same old story<br>
Greed and profit's allegory<br>
I see kids who go to school.<br>
<br>
A vote for one, a vote for all<br>
A right to silence, one free call<br>
You'll need a warrant for that<br>
No she won't sit in the back,<br>
And yes we're still abolishing all slavery<br>
Every kind of slavery<br>
<br>
So write this number down and know you won't slip through the cracks.<br>
Look over your shoulder, there's millions of us there to get your backs.<br>
You can play a crucial part,<br>
Carry justice in your heart,<br>
And we'll be there to get your backs.<br>
<br>
Welcome to this land, and yes we still have all those marble steps to climb,<br>
But write this number down, because it's growing all the time.<br>
</p>
