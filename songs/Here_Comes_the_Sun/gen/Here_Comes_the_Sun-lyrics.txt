... it's all right   
... Little darling, it's been a long cold, lonely winter
... Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here  
... Here comes the  sun ... Here comes the  sun, and I say
... it's all right   
   
... Little darling, the smiles re turning to their faces
... Little darling, it seems like years since its been here 
... Here comes the  sun ... Here comes the  sun, and I say
... it's all right   
    
Sun, sun sun, here it comes   
Sun, sun sun, here it comes   
Sun, sun sun, here it comes   
Sun, sun sun, here it comes   
Sun, sun sun, here it comes   
   
... Little darling,  I feel that ice is slowly melting  
... Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear 
... Here comes the  sun ... Here comes the  sun, and I say
... it's all right   
... Here comes the  sun ... Here comes the  sun, and I say
... it's all right   
... it's all right
