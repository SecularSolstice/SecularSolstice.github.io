<p>Including the scientific method as verse three is very deliberate. When we judge for ourselves, we are still applying what we’ve been taught <em>about doing that</em>.</p>
<p>The phrase “garden full of forking paths” comes from Andrew Gelman: a frequentist. Cope.</p>
<p>The sheet music and chord chart do not exactly agree. The chord chart is closer to what was performed.</p>
<p>If performing with more than voice and guitar, other instruments should probably stay quiet while the problem is being explained, and come in as it is resolved.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  got a problem...<br>
  The weather's getting cold<br>
  The northern wind blows harsh and swift<br>
  My jacket's worn and old<br>
  But all I need to know is in<br>
  the tales my poppa told...<br>
  I choose a pelt that's thick and warm.<br>
  I measure twice; I chalk my form.<br>
  I cut and stitch ere coming storm!<br>
  And now I'm safe and snug.<br>
<br>
  got a problem...<br>
  It seems I've lost my way.<br>
  I journeyed forth to lands unknown.<br>
  Been wandering all day.<br>
  I need some help. Can I recall:<br>
  What did my momma say?<br>
  I lift my eyes up past the air,<br>
  follow the tail of Greater Bear.<br>
  I see that north is over there!<br>
  And now I'm homeward bound.<br>
  I<br>
<br>
got a problem...<br>
What if this lore's not true?<br>
What if what worked in days of old<br>
don't work for me and you?<br>
I don't despair. I got a plan:<br>
what grandpa said to do!<br>
I check the facts with my own eyes<br>
I do the math I analyze<br>
I get a p less than oh five!<br>
And now that problem's solved.<br>
I<br>
<br>
got a problem...<br>
Results won't replicate.<br>
A garden full of forking paths,<br>
the choice to speak too late.<br>
Can Sol'monoff quite help me here?<br>
Do I, um, hang on, wait!<br>
I...<br>
