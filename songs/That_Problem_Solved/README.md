#  That Problem Solved

Including the scientific method as verse three is very deliberate.
When we judge for ourselves, we are still applying what we've been
taught *about doing that*.

The phrase "garden full of forking paths" comes from Andrew Gelman: a
frequentist.  Cope.

The sheet music and chord chart do not exactly agree.  The chord chart
is closer to what was performed.

If performing with more than voice and guitar, other instruments
should probably stay quiet while the problem is being explained, and
come in as it is resolved.
