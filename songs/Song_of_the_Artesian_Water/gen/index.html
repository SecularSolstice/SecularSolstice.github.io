<h2 id="by-banjo-paterson-and-anna-tchetchekine">By Banjo Paterson and Anna Tchetchekine</h2>
<h2 id="a-song-about-human-ingenuity-in-the-face-of-challenges.">A song about human ingenuity in the face of challenges.</h2>
<p>A song about drilling down for artesian water , using machinery in a life-or-death situation. Similar in flavor to “Hymn to the Breaking Strain.”</p>
<p>This was set to music by Anna Tchetchekine for the Bay Solstice in 2021. There is just <a href="../Song_of_the_Artesian_Water_v2.m4a">one recording</a> (featuring Anna) and a chord chart, no sheet music as of yet.</p>
<p>It has also been set to music by Cathy O’Sullivan, a recording of which version <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2rQSJqQnFE">can be found here</a>. The Cathy O’Sullivan version is unrelated to Anna Tchetchekine’s arrangement and thus won’t match the chord chart on this page.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Now the stock have started dying, for the Lord has sent a drought,<br>
But we're sick of prayers and Providence -- we're going to do without,<br>
With the derricks up above us and the solid earth below,<br>
We are waiting at the lever for the word to let her go.<br>
Sinking down, deeper down,<br>
Oh, we'll sink it deeper down:<br>
As the drill is plugging downward at a thousand feet of level,<br>
If the Lord won't send us water, oh, we'll get it from the devil;<br>
Yes, we'll get it from the devil deeper down.<br>
<br>
Now, our engine's built in Glasgow by a very canny Scot,<br>
And he marked it twenty horse-power, but he didn't know what’s what.<br>
When Canadian Bill is firing with the sun-dried gidgee logs,<br>
She can equal thirty horses and a score or so of dogs.<br>
Sinking down, deeper down<br>
Oh, we're going deeper down:<br>
If we fail to get the water, then it's ruin to the squatter,<br>
For the drought is on the station and the weather's growing hotter,<br>
But we're bound to get the water deeper down.<br>
<br>
But the shaft has started caving and the sinking's very slow,<br>
And the yellow rods are bending in the water down below,<br>
And the tubes are always jamming, and they can't be made to shift<br>
Till we nearly burst the engine with a forty horse-power lift,<br>
Sinking down, deeper down,<br>
Oh, we're going deeper down:<br>
Though the shaft is always caving, and the tubes are always jamming,<br>
Yet we'll fight our way to water while the stubborn drill is ramming-<br>
While the stubborn drill is ramming deeper down.<br>
<br>
But there's no artesian water, though we're passed three thousand feet,<br>
And the contract price is growing, and the boss is nearly beat.<br>
But it must be down beneath us, and it's down we've got to go.<br>
Though she's bumping on the solid rock four thousand feet below,<br>
Sinking down, deeper down,<br>
Oh, we're going deeper down:<br>
And it's time they heard us knocking on the roof of Satan's dwellin',<br>
But we'll get artesian water if we cave the roof of hell in-<br>
Oh we'll get artesian water deeper down.<br>
<br>
But it's hark! the whistle's blowing with a wild, exultant blast,<br>
And the boys are madly cheering, for they've struck the flow at last:<br>
And it's rushing up the tubing from four thousand feet below,<br>
Till it spouts above the casing in a million-gallon flow.<br>
And it's down, deeper down-<br>
Oh, it comes from deeper down:<br>
It is flowing, ever flowing, in a free, unstinted measure<br>
From the silent hidden places where the old earth hides her treasure-<br>
Where the old earth hides her treasure deeper down.<br>
<br>
And it's clear away the timber and it's let the water run,<br>
How it glimmers in the shadow, how it flashes in the sun!<br>
By the silent belts of timber, by the miles of blazing plain<br>
It is bringing hope and comfort to the thirsty land again.<br>
Flowing down, further down:<br>
It is flowing further down<br>
To the tortured thirsty cattle, bringing gladness in its going;<br>
Through the droughty days of summer it is flowing, ever flowing-<br>
It is flowing, ever flowing, further down.<br>
</p>
