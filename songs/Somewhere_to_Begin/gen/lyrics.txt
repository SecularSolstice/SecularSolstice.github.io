People say to me, oh, you gotta be crazy
How can you sing in times like these
Don’t you read the news
Don’t you know the score
How can you sing
when so many others grieve
People say to me
what kind of fool believes that a song
will make a difference in the end
By way of a reply, I say a fool such as I
Who sees a song as somewhere to begin
A song is somewhere to begin
The search for something
worth believing in
If changes are to come
there are things that must be done
And a song is somewhere to begin

People say to me, oh, you gotta be crazy
How can you dream in times like these
Don’t you read the news
Don’t you know the score
How can you dream
when so many others grieve
People say to me
what kind of fool believes that a dream
will make a difference in the end
By way of a reply, I say a fool such as I
Who sees a dream as somewhere to begin
A dream is somewhere to begin
The search for something
worth believing in
If changes are to come
there are things that must be done
And a dream is somewhere to begin

People say to me, oh, you gotta be crazy
How can you love in times like these
Don’t you read the news
Don’t you know the score
How can you love
when so many others grieve
People say to me
what kind of fool believes that love
will make a difference in the end
By way of a reply, I say a fool such as I
Who sees love as somewhere to begin
And love is somewhere to begin
The search for something
worth believing in
If changes are to come
there are things that must be done

And love is somewhere 
And a dream is somewhere
And a song is somewhere to begin
