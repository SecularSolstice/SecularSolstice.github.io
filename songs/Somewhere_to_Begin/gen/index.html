<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
People say to me, oh, you gotta be crazy<br>
How can you sing in times like these<br>
Don’t you read the news<br>
Don’t you know the score<br>
How can you sing<br>
when so many others grieve<br>
People say to me<br>
what kind of fool believes that a song<br>
will make a difference in the end<br>
By way of a reply, I say a fool such as I<br>
Who sees a song as somewhere to begin<br>
A song is somewhere to begin<br>
The search for something<br>
worth believing in<br>
If changes are to come<br>
there are things that must be done<br>
And a song is somewhere to begin<br>
<br>
People say to me, oh, you gotta be crazy<br>
How can you dream in times like these<br>
Don’t you read the news<br>
Don’t you know the score<br>
How can you dream<br>
when so many others grieve<br>
People say to me<br>
what kind of fool believes that a dream<br>
will make a difference in the end<br>
By way of a reply, I say a fool such as I<br>
Who sees a dream as somewhere to begin<br>
A dream is somewhere to begin<br>
The search for something<br>
worth believing in<br>
If changes are to come<br>
there are things that must be done<br>
And a dream is somewhere to begin<br>
<br>
People say to me, oh, you gotta be crazy<br>
How can you love in times like these<br>
Don’t you read the news<br>
Don’t you know the score<br>
How can you love<br>
when so many others grieve<br>
People say to me<br>
what kind of fool believes that love<br>
will make a difference in the end<br>
By way of a reply, I say a fool such as I<br>
Who sees love as somewhere to begin<br>
And love is somewhere to begin<br>
The search for something<br>
worth believing in<br>
If changes are to come<br>
there are things that must be done<br>
<br>
And love is somewhere<br>
And a dream is somewhere<br>
And a song is somewhere to begin<br>
