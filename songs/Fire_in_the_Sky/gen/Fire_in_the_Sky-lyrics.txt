Prometheus, they say, 
Brought God’s fire down to Man, 
And we’ve caught it, tamed, it, trained it
Since our history began
Now we’re going back to Heaven, 
Just to look him in the eye
And there’s a thunder ‘cross the land, 
and a fire in the sky

Gagarin was the first, 
Back in 1961
When, like Icarus, undaunted, 
He climbed to reach the sun.
And he knew he might not make it, 
For it’s never hard to die, 
But he lifted off the pad,
and rode a fire in the sky

Yet a higher goal was calling, 
And we voted to reach it soon,
And we gave ourselves a decade
To put fire on the moon.
And Apollo told the world
We can do it if we try
There was one small step,
and a fire in the sky

Then two decades from Gagarin, 
Twenty years to the day,
Came a shuttle named Columbia
To open up the way. 
And they said she’s just a truck, 
But she’s a truck that’s aiming high. 
See her big jets burning, 
See her fire in the sky

Yet the gods do not give lightly
Of the powers the have made, 
And with Challenger and seven, 
Once again the price is paid. 
Though a nation watched falling, 
Yet a world could only cry
As they passed from us to glory,
riding fire in the sky

Now the rest is up to us: 
There’s a future to be won! 
We must turn our faces outward, 
We will do what must be done. 
For no cradle lasts forever, 
Every bird must learn to fly,
And we’re going to the stars,
See our fire in the sky

Yes, we’re going to the stars, 
See our fire in the sky!
