<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Prometheus, they say,<br>
Brought God’s fire down to Man,<br>
And we’ve caught it, tamed, it, trained it<br>
Since our history began<br>
Now we’re going back to Heaven,<br>
Just to look him in the eye<br>
And there’s a thunder ‘cross the land,<br>
and a fire in the sky<br>
<br>
Gagarin was the first,<br>
Back in 1961<br>
When, like Icarus, undaunted,<br>
He climbed to reach the sun.<br>
And he knew he might not make it,<br>
For it’s never hard to die,<br>
But he lifted off the pad,<br>
and rode a fire in the sky<br>
<br>
Yet a higher goal was calling,<br>
And we voted to reach it soon,<br>
And we gave ourselves a decade<br>
To put fire on the moon.<br>
And Apollo told the world<br>
We can do it if we try<br>
There was one small step,<br>
and a fire in the sky<br>
<br>
Then two decades from Gagarin,<br>
Twenty years to the day,<br>
Came a shuttle named Columbia<br>
To open up the way.<br>
And they said she’s just a truck,<br>
But she’s a truck that’s aiming high.<br>
See her big jets burning,<br>
See her fire in the sky<br>
<br>
Yet the gods do not give lightly<br>
Of the powers the have made,<br>
And with Challenger and seven,<br>
Once again the price is paid.<br>
Though a nation watched falling,<br>
Yet a world could only cry<br>
As they passed from us to glory,<br>
riding fire in the sky<br>
<br>
Now the rest is up to us:<br>
There’s a future to be won!<br>
We must turn our faces outward,<br>
We will do what must be done.<br>
For no cradle lasts forever,<br>
Every bird must learn to fly,<br>
And we’re going to the stars,<br>
See our fire in the sky<br>
<br>
Yes, we’re going to the stars,<br>
See our fire in the sky!<br>
