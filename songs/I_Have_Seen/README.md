# I Have Seen the Tops of Clouds
## By Daniel Speyer
## The miracles of today taken in context

Based on the blog post [I Have Seen the Tops of Clouds](https://medium.com/message/i-have-seen-the-tops-of-clouds-e21c5941de32) by Quinn Norton.

I had to invent two small bits of musical notation.  When the voice
has a dotted whole note, that means to hold through the next measure
with the lyrics there sung by someone else.  Possibly by the
audience.  *Mostly* the song calls for a single singer -- just not
those echoes.  Also, the C^1.3^ chord means just the major third (C and
E) with neither A nor G.  It's the intersection of A Minor and C Major
and is therefore ambiguous as to what it's a part of.

Placing this song in the arc may be tricky.  It's a little dark for
morning, but the light in it is clearly the light of morning and not
the light of the day before.  The cello parts that keep trying to turn
the melody into major chords seem to help keep it lighter, though.

This song is available in the original a-minor/c-major or in
e-minor/g-major for lower voices (see the -drop sheet music).  This
required raising the cello an octave to avoid falling of the bottom of
the instrument.
