<p>I had to invent two small bits of musical notation. When the voice has a dotted whole note, that means to hold through the next measure with the lyrics there sung by someone else. Possibly by the audience. <em>Mostly</em> the song calls for a single singer – just not those echoes. Also, the C<sup>1.3</sup> chord means just the major third (C and E) with neither A nor G. It’s the intersection of A Minor and C Major and is therefore ambiguous as to what it’s a part of.</p>
<p>Placing this song in the arc may be tricky. It’s a little dark for morning, but the light in it is clearly the light of morning and not the light of the day before. The cello parts that keep trying to turn the melody into major chords seem to help keep it lighter, though.</p>
<p>This song is available in the original a-minor/c-major or in e-minor/g-major for lower voices (see the -drop sheet music). This required raising the cello an octave to avoid falling of the bottom of the instrument.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  Some nights I awake from my bed in cold terror<br>
  with echoes of nightmares just roaming my skin.<br>
  All the wrongs, all the dangers I hold off in daytime<br>
  return to my thoughts as the night closes in.<br>
<br>
  It gets so much harder when monsters are true.<br>
  I can't quite imagine just what we could do.<br>
  A miracle's needed to see us all through.<br>
  But what have we got?  We've got me; we've got you.<br>
  And I...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      I have seen the tops of clouds.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      I can breathe beneath the sea.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      I laugh with friends from across the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Where I go a library goes with me.<br>
<br>
  This isn't a thing that our past selves expected.<br>
  Lord Kelvin assured us that steel cannot fly.<br>
  His mistake was quite subtle and all we need hope for<br>
  Is similar errors in proofs we'll all die.<br>
<br>
  And if we yet meet with the end that we fear,<br>
  'Twill still have been good that this once we were here:<br>
  For one shining moment life saw itself clear,<br>
  And dreamed of how soon to the stars it might steer.<br>
  And how...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      I have seen the tops of clouds.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      I can breathe beneath the sea.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      I laugh with friends from across the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Where I go a library goes with me.<br>
<br>
  Yes I have seen the tops of clouds (tops of clouds)<br>
  And you can breathe beneath the sea (the sea)<br>
  And how we laugh with friends from across the world<br>
  Where I go a library goes with me.  Goes with me.<br>
  Goes with me!<br>
