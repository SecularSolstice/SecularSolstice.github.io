<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
The circle of the world shines bright and holy<br>
The seasons tread their spiral path with grace<br>
It is not the world's designer but the world itself we honor<br>
And the stars shine out across our Lady's face<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      But the world might end -- and the stars might fall<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Yet Her light will be laughing at the heart of it all<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      She is in each force with strangeness and charm<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And the holographic universe is enfolded in Her arms<br>
<br>
Our Lady is non-local; sing we Her praise<br>
She is the hidden variable that lights our days<br>
With book and with candle<br>
With Gödel and Bell<br>
With wave and with particle we worship Her well<br>
<br>
Our Lady is uncertain; sing we in prayer<br>
We don't know how fast She may be moving or where<br>
With koan and theorem<br>
With Pauli and Bohr<br>
We open Her mysteries and inside we find more<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      For the world might end -- and the stars might fall<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Still Her light will be laughing at the heart of it all<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      She is in each force with strangeness and charm<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And the holographic universe is enfolded in her arms<br>
<br>
Our Lady is acausal; work we Her math<br>
Her field equations are a bitch and a half<br>
With implicate order<br>
And synchronous net<br>
She weaves riddles so fine we can't unravel them yet<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And the world might end -- and the stars might fall<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Still Her light will be laughing at the heart of it all<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      She is in each force with strangeness and charm<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And the holographic universe is enfolded in Her arms<br>
