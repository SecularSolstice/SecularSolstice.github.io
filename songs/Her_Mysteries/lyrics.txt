The circle of the world shines bright and holy 
The seasons tread their spiral path with grace 
It is not the world's designer but the world itself we honor 
And the stars shine out across our Lady's face 

        But the world might end -- and the stars might fall 
        Yet Her light will be laughing at the heart of it all 
        She is in each force with strangeness and charm 
        And the holographic universe is enfolded in Her arms 

Our Lady is non-local; sing we Her praise 
She is the hidden variable that lights our days 
With book and with candle 
With GÃ¶del and Bell 
With wave and with particle we worship Her well 

Our Lady is uncertain; sing we in prayer 
We don't know how fast She may be moving or where 
With koan and theorem 
With Pauli and Bohr 
We open Her mysteries and inside we find more 

        For the world might end -- and the stars might fall 
        Still Her light will be laughing at the heart of it all 
        She is in each force with strangeness and charm 
        And the holographic universe is enfolded in her arms 

Our Lady is acausal; work we Her math 
Her field equations are a bitch and a half 
With implicate order 
And synchronous net 
She weaves riddles so fine we can't unravel them yet 

        And the world might end -- and the stars might fall 
        Still Her light will be laughing at the heart of it all 
        She is in each force with strangeness and charm 
        And the holographic universe is enfolded in Her arms
