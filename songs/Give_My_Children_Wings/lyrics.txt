Give my children wings, but not the ghosts of wings
I have found in the words of the dreamers
Let them fly away to a world so far away
From the fools and the cruel and the schemers
Give them stars to juggle and comets for their toys
A new life to build from their sorrows and joys
Give my children wings, but not the ghosts of wings
I have found in the words of the dreamers

Give my children suns, but not the songs of suns
That have nourished me all through my growing
Songs can give them hope, but they need more than hope
All their dreams are but seeds meant for sowing
Give them the planets, a universe to share
With all who are waiting to meet them out there
Give my children suns, but not the songs of suns
That have nourished me all through my growing

Give my children life, a vast eternal life
And a universe teeming with wonder
Continents and skies, a million different skies
Full of rainbows and snowflakes and thunders
Give them bright tomorrows and not our dark todays
Realms of love and beauty to cherish all their days
Give my children life, a vast eternal life
And a universe teeming with wonder
