The careful textbooks measure... let all who build be-  ware
The load, the shock, the pressure... ma-  te-r-i-al can bear
So when the buckled  girder... lets down the grinding span
The blame of loss or  murder... is la-id upon the man
  ... ... not on the steel... ... ... the man
 interlude   (skip)
But in our dail - y dealings... with stone and steel we find
The gods have no such feeling... of justice towards man kind
To no set gauge they make us... to no laid course pre- pare
In time they over take us... with loads we cannot bear
  ... ... to merci less... ... ... to bear

The pru-dent text-books give it... in ta - bles at... the end
The stress that shears a rivet... or  makes a tie - bar bend
What traffic wrecks ma- cadam... what concrete should en- dure
But we poor sons of  Adam... have  no such li - tera - ture
  ... ... to warn us or... make sure...

We hold all Earth to plun der... all time and space as well
Too won-der stale to won-der... at each new mira - cle
Till in the mid ill - lusion... Of Godhood 'neath our hand
Falls multiple con- fusion... On all we did or planned
  ... ... The mighty works... we planned...

We on - ly in crea tion... (how-much luckier the bridge and rail)
A- bide the twin damn- nation... To fail and know we failed
Yet we by which sole token... We know we once were Gods
Take shame in being  broken... How- ever great the odds
  ... ... The bur- den of... the odds...
 interlude   (skip)
Oh veiled and se - cret power... whose paths we seek in vain
Be with us in our  hour... of o-ver-throw and pain
That we by which sole to- ken... we know thy ways are  TRUE
In spite of be-ing broken... or be cause of be-ing  broken
  ... rise up and build... a-new...
