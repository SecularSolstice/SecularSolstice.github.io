    <meta property='og:description' content=' By Rudyard Kipling //  Abide the twin damnation, to fail and know we fail // Some solstices have used the [Leslie Fish melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57LxbIBcTjE).  Others have used a different melody which does not seem to be recorded anywhere.  Yet another option is to use Fishs *melody*, but combine it with darker and simpler harmonies (see [2020 version](../Hymn-Breaking-Strain-2020.mp3) ). For several years, the Bay Solstice used some version of [this abridged arrangement for three voices](../Hymn_to_Breaking_Strain_abridged_3_voices.pdf) (note that this is in Bb minor, whereas the original is in A minor). // ' />

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
-<br>
The careful textbooks measure... let all who build be-  ware<br>
The load, the shock, the pressure... ma-  te-r-i-al can bear<br>
So when the buckled  girder... lets down the grinding span<br>
The blame of loss or  murder... is la-id upon the man<br>
  ... ... not on the steel... ... ... the man<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
But in our dail - y dealings... with stone and steel we find<br>
The gods have no such feeling... of justice towards man kind<br>
To no set gauge they make us... to no laid course pre- pare<br>
In time they over take us... with loads we cannot bear<br>
  ... ... to merci less... ... ... to bear<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
The pru-dent text-books give it... in ta - bles at... the end<br>
The stress that shears a rivet... or  makes a tie - bar bend<br>
What traffic wrecks ma- cadam... what concrete should en- dure<br>
But we poor sons of  Adam... have  no such li - tera - ture<br>
  ... ... to warn us or... make sure...<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
We hold all Earth to plun der... all time and space as well<br>
Too won-der stale to won-der... at each new mira - cle<br>
Till in the mid ill - lusion... Of Godhood 'neath our hand<br>
Falls multiple con- fusion... On all we did or planned<br>
  ... ... The mighty works... we planned...<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
We on - ly in crea tion... (how-much luckier the bridge and rail)<br>
A- bide the twin damn- nation... To fail and know we failed<br>
Yet we by which sole token... We know we once were Gods<br>
Take shame in being  broken... How- ever great the odds<br>
  ... ... The bur- den of... the odds...<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
Oh veiled and se - cret power... whose paths we seek in vain<br>
Be with us in our  hour... of o-ver-throw and pain<br>
That we by which sole to- ken... we know thy ways are  TRUE<br>
In spite of be-ing broken... or be cause of be-ing  broken<br>
  ... rise up and build... a-new...<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
