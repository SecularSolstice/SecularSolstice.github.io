#  Hymn to the Breaking Strain
## By Rudyard Kipling
## Abide the twin damnation, to fail and know we fail

Some solstices have used the [Leslie Fish melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57LxbIBcTjE).  Others have used a different melody which does not seem to be recorded anywhere.  Yet another option is to use Fish's *melody*, but combine it with darker and simpler harmonies (see [2020 version](../Hymn-Breaking-Strain-2020.mp3) ).

[A recording of this from the 2020 North American Distributed Chorus](https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2020/07-breaking-strain---bitter-wind--2020-12-20-020459.mp3) is available.
