 walk with me...            We'll journey through
And maybe talk with me...               As partners do 
   
 Here comes the dark again...    clawing at my heart like a hungry beast  
 Shutting down my eyes like a flask that's empty  
 I want to walk on the solid ground. I want to know what you've been through  
 Want to face what comes together. I am safer with you.  
So stranger walk with me...              I'm  walking too...
 walk with me...            We'll journey through
And maybe talk with me...               As partners do 
 Walk with me. Talk with me. Stop with me.  
 As friends can do.
