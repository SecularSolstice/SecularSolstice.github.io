 Brother is quietly holding her tight 
 Hurrying home and I hope there's still time for 
 One... more... night... 
 Slowly she turns... opens her eyes 
 Struggles to stand point to the sky 
 Barely can breathe but she's telling the stor-ies 
 One... last... time... 
And she whispers of hunters and dra-gons and gods 
 Wanderers roaming the stars up a - bove 
 Holding her hand in that moment I wonder, 
 Can't help but wonder at all... those... 
 End... less... lights... burning with
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them
 One... more... reason to wonder
Is anyone out there,is anyone out there?
 anyone out there tonight 
 
 
 
 
 Father is waiting for sister and me 
 Thousands of miles away, over the sea and we're 
 Flying as fast as the Boeing'll carry us 
 One... last... time... 
 Thinking of stories he told from the war 
 Terrible jokes that he made us endure 
 Daylight is ending, the plane is descending 
 Just... in... time... ... as the
 clouds part around us, a dazz-l-ing city 
A ppears like a jewel in the night... 
And I look at our home and its lights all a - glow'n and I 
 Can't help but wonder at all.. those...
 End... less... lights, burning with
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them
 One... more... reason to wonder
Is anyone out there, anyone out there?
 End... less... night cradling
 Count... less... voices, reaching
A cross.. the vast-ness... 
With beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they
 can... 
 Beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they
 can... 
 
 Grandma's been waiting for clues in the dark, and I'm 
 Journeying millions of miles to take part. 
And finally I see her glint in the viewing port,
 Right... on... time... 
 Weightless em brace as the airlock re- seals,
 Space station turning and slowly re- veals:
 Rows upon rows of her telescopes listening
 Deep... through... time... C F
And maybe there's some kind of somebody o-ut there
 Listening in on our radio calls
Or maybe there's not there's just one pale blue dot to give 
 Meaning and beauty and worth to it all.
But holding her hand in that moment I wonder,
 Can't help but wonder at all wonder at all... those...
 End... less... lights, burning with
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them
 One... more... reason to wonder
Is anyone out there... anyone out there?
 End... less... night cradling
 Count... less... voices, reaching 
A cross... the vast-ness... 
With beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they
 can... 
 beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they 
 can... 
 beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they long as they
 can
