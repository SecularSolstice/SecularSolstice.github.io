<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<h2 id="a-song-of-hope-generations-stories-and-infinite-possibilities">A song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities</h2>
<p>This song was written specifically to serve as a replacement for <a href="../Brighter_Than_Today">Brighter Than Today</a> for if/when we needed one. As such, the two often have a bit of tension about where they go. At NYC2017 and NYC2019 we tried relieving that tension with slides, declaring “dawn” at the end of Brighter Than Today and increased the lighting throughout Endless Lights.</p>
<p>An alternative we tried in NYC2018 is to split this into Endless Lights Above Me (the first verse) in Twilight and Endless Lights Around Me (the other two verses) in Morning. There was some pushback and it didn’t fit the rest of 2019 as well, so we reverted it.</p>
<p>At NYC2019 we alternated singers on the verses and had both for the choruses, which worked well (live audio recording in the files section).</p>

<p>This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the <a href="https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2015">2015</a> album.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Mama's been waiting, huddled out - side.<br>
 Brother is quietly holding her tight<br>
 Hurrying home and I hope there's still time for<br>
 One... more... night...<br>
 Slowly she turns... opens her eyes<br>
 Struggles to stand point to the sky<br>
 Barely can breathe but she's telling the stor-ies<br>
 One... last... time...<br>
And she whispers of hunters and dra-gons and gods<br>
 Wanderers roaming the stars up a - bove<br>
 Holding her hand in that moment I wonder,<br>
 Can't help but wonder at all... those...<br>
 End... less... lights... burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there,is anyone out there?<br>
 anyone out there tonight<br>
<br>
 Father is waiting for sister and me<br>
 Thousands of miles away, over the sea and we're<br>
 Flying as fast as the Boeing'll carry us<br>
 One... last... time...<br>
 Thinking of stories he told from the war<br>
 Terrible jokes that he made us endure<br>
 Daylight is ending, the plane is descending<br>
 Just... in... time... ... as the<br>
 clouds part around us, a dazz-l-ing city<br>
A ppears like a jewel in the night...<br>
And I look at our home and its lights all a - glow'n and I<br>
 Can't help but wonder at all.. those...<br>
 End... less... lights, burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there, anyone out there?<br>
 End... less... night cradling<br>
 Count... less... voices, reaching<br>
A cross.. the vast-ness...<br>
With beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can...<br>
 Beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can...<br>
<br>
 Grandma's been waiting for clues in the dark, and I'm<br>
 Journeying millions of miles to take part.<br>
And finally I see her glint in the viewing port,<br>
 Right... on... time...<br>
 Weightless em brace as the airlock re- seals,<br>
 Space station turning and slowly re- veals:<br>
 Rows upon rows of her telescopes listening<br>
 Deep... through... time... C F<br>
And maybe there's some kind of somebody o-ut there<br>
 Listening in on our radio calls<br>
Or maybe there's not there's just one pale blue dot to give<br>
 Meaning and beauty and worth to it all.<br>
But holding her hand in that moment I wonder,<br>
 Can't help but wonder at all wonder at all... those...<br>
 End... less... lights, burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there... anyone out there?<br>
 End... less... night cradling<br>
 Count... less... voices, reaching<br>
A cross... the vast-ness...<br>
With beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can...<br>
 beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can...<br>
 beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they long as they<br>
 can<br>
