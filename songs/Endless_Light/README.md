#  Endless Lights
## By Raymond Arnold
## A song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities

This song was written specifically to serve as a replacement for
[Brighter Than Today](../Brighter_Than_Today) for if/when we needed
one.  As such, the two often have a bit of tension about where they
go.  At NYC2017 and NYC2019 we tried relieving that tension with slides, declaring
"dawn" at the end of Brighter Than Today and increased the lighting
throughout Endless Lights.

An alternative we tried in NYC2018 is to split this into Endless Lights
Above Me (the first verse) in Twilight and Endless Lights Around Me
(the other two verses) in Morning.  There was some pushback and it
didn't fit the rest of 2019 as well, so we reverted it.

At NYC2019 we alternated singers on the verses and had both for the choruses, which worked well (live audio recording in the files section).

This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the [2015](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2015) album.
