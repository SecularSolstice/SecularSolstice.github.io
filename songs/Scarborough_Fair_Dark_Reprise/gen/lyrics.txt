And now remember those who fell
Emâ€™ralds apples cradles and waves
Please save us from the tithe to hell
From fairies, demons, elves and wraiths

Emeralds, apples, cradles and waves
May flowers bloom on madhouse walls
Of fairies, demons, elves and wraiths
May ballads ring through gloomy halls

The fae are cold, they do not mind
Memories grow weary with time
The terror that they leave behind
She was once a true love of mine
