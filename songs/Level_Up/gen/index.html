<p>Jeff Kaufman noted five issues with the song for solstice
purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the words are pickups.</li>
<li>The lines don’t start on a consistent beat.</li>
<li>Sections have small differences each time they’re repeated.</li>
<li>It’s not square. (i.e. section lengths are not powers of two)</li>
<li>The sung portion ends with a build and the song’s conclusion is
instrumental, which is not satisfying for group singing.</li>
</ul>
<p>So he and Alex Gorowara created a <a
href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/simplified-level-up">simplified
version</a> with lyrics, chords and mp3.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
so come out.<br>
you have been waiting long enough.<br>
you’re done with all the talk talk talk with nothing on the table.<br>
it’s time to come on out.<br>
there will be no sign from above.<br>
you’ll only hear the knock knock knock of your own heart as signal.<br>
<br>
if you are afraid, come out.<br>
if you are awake, come out.<br>
come out and level up.<br>
<br>
begin again.<br>
dynamite the dam on the flow.<br>
your body feels the tock tock tock of time as it hammers.<br>
lord we are all cinders<br>
from a fire burning long ago,<br>
but here it is the knock knock knock of your own heart that matters.<br>
<br>
if you are afraid, come forth.<br>
if you are alone, come forth now.<br>
everybody here has loved and lost,<br>
so level up and love again.<br>
<br>
call it any name you need.<br>
call it your 2.0, your rebirth, whatever –<br>
so long as you can feel it all,<br>
so long as all your doors are flung wide.<br>
call it your day no. 1 in the rest of forever.<br>
<br>
if you are afraid, give more.<br>
if you are alive, give more now.<br>
everybody here has seams and scars.<br>
so what. level up.<br>
<br>
let your faith die.<br>
bring your wonder.<br>
yes, you are only one.<br>
no, it is not enough<br>
but if you lift your eyes, I am your brother.<br>
and this is all we need.<br>
and this is where we start.<br>
this is the day we greet.<br>
this is the day, no other.<br>
</p>
