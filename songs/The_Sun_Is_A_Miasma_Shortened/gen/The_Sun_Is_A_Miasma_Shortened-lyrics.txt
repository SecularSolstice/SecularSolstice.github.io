The sun is a miasma
Of incandescent plasma
The sun's not simply made out of gas
No, no, no

The sun can inspire
But it's not made of fire
Forget what you've been told in the past

(Plasma!) Electrons are free
(Plasma!) A fourth way to be
Not gas, not liquid, not solid

(Plasma!) Forget that song
(Plasma!) They got it wrong
That thesis has been rendered invalid

The sun is a miasma
Of incandescent plasma
The sun's not simply made out of gas
No, no, no

The sun can inspire
But it's not made of fire
Let's see just how long it can last
