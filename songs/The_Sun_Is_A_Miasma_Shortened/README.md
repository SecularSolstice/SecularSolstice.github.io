# The Sun Is A Miasma of Incandescent Plasma, Shortened
## By They Might Be Giants and Raymond Arnold
## An truly modern ode to the sun

Based on TMBG's own [The Sun Is A Miasma of Incandescent Plasma](../../The_Sun_Is_A_Miasma/gen) but shorter, more solsticy and (arguably) with better rhymes.  Exact orgiin unknown.
