<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count it's many tears,<br>
while we all sup sorrow with the poor<br>
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears;<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more.<br>
<br>
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,<br>
there are frail forms fainting at the door<br>
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say;<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more.<br>
<br>
Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,<br>
hard times, hard times, come again no more<br>
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more.<br>
<br>
There's a pale sorrow maiden who toils her life away,<br>
with a worn heart whose better days are o'er:<br>
Though her voice would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more.<br>
<br>
Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,<br>
hard times, hard times, come again no more<br>
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more.<br>
<br>
Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,<br>
tis a wail that is heard upon the shore<br>
Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave;<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more.<br>
<br>
Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,<br>
hard times, hard times, come again no more<br>
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more.<br>
<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more.<br>
<br>
Oh, hard times come again no more. . . .<br>
