<p>This has been introduced as “a Canadian folk song about trying to do the impossible”. but to me (dspeyer) the theme that most resonates is “No matter what you’ve lost, … like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!” Both themes are present, and subjective experience is subjective.</p>
<p>Many versions of this song are on youtube. My personal favorite is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKsVidS70xQ">one from Longest Johns</a></p>

# Intro<br>
<br>
.<br>
<br>
# Verse<br>
<br>
She went down last October,<br>
In a pouring driving rain,<br>
The skipper he'd been drinking and<br>
The mate he felt no pain,<br>
Too close to Three Mile Rock and<br>
She was dealt her mortal blow and<br>
The Mary Ellen Carter settled low.<br>
There was just us five aboard her,<br>
When she finally was awash,<br>
We worked like hell to save her,<br>
All heedless of the cost, and<br>
The groan she gave as she went down,<br>
It caused us to proclaim,<br>
That the Mary Ellen Carter would rise again.<br>
<br>
# Break<br>
<br>
Well the owners wrote her off,<br>
Not a nickel would they spend,<br>
"She gave twenty years of service, boys,<br>
Then met her sorry end.<br>
But insurance paid the loss to us,<br>
So let her rest be- low.",<br>
Then they laughed at us, and,<br>
Said we had to go.<br>
<br>
# Verse<br>
<br>
But we talked of her all winter,<br>
Some days around the clock.<br>
She's worth a quarter million,<br>
Afloating at the dock and<br>
With every jar that hit the bar,<br>
We swore we would remain and<br>
Make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!<br>
<br>
# Chorus<br>
<br>
Rise again, rise again,<br>
That her name not be lost,<br>
To the knowledge of men,<br>
All those who loved her best and<br>
Were with her 'til the end,<br>
Will make the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.<br>
<br>
# Break<br>
<br>
All spring now we've been with her,<br>
On a barge lent by a friend.<br>
Three dives a day in a hardhat suit, and<br>
Twice I've had the bends.<br>
Thank God it's only sixty feet, and<br>
The currents here are slow, or<br>
I'd never have the strength,<br>
To go below.<br>
But we've patched her rents, stopped her vents,<br>
Dogged hatch, and Portholes down,<br>
Put cables to her, fore and aft and<br>
Girded her around,<br>
Tomorrow noon, we hit the air and<br>
Then take up the strain, and<br>
Make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!<br>
<br>
# Chorus<br>
<br>
Rise again, rise again,<br>
That her name not be lost,<br>
To the knowledge of men,<br>
All those who loved her best and<br>
Were with her 'til the end,<br>
Will make the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.<br>
<br>
# Break<br>
<br>
For we couldn't leave her there,<br>
You see to crumble into scale.<br>
She'd saved our lives, so many times,<br>
Living through the gale, and<br>
The laughing, drunken rats,<br>
Who left her to a sorry grave,<br>
They won't be laughing in another day, and<br>
You, to whom adversity, has dealt the final blow,<br>
With smiling bastards lying to you,<br>
Everywhere you go,<br>
Turn to, and put out all your strength,<br>
Of arm, and heart and brain, and<br>
Like the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!<br>
<br>
# 2nd Chorus<br>
<br>
Rise again, rise again,<br>
Though your heart, it be broken, or<br>
Life about to end,<br>
No matter what you've lost,<br>
Be it a home, a love, a friend,<br>
Like the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!<br>
<br>
Rise again, rise again,<br>
Though your heart, it be broken, or<br>
Life about to end,<br>
No matter what you've lost,<br>
Be it a home, a love, a friend,<br>
Like the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!<br>
<br>
