<h2 id="a-return-to-bitter-wind-blown-but-with-determination-to-do-something-about-it">A return to Bitter Wind Blown, but with determination to do something about it</h2>
<p>Musically, this song is a reprise of <a href="../../Bitter_Wind_Blown/gen/">Bitter Wind Blown</a> and it has been known as “Bitter Wind Reprise” in some documents. Conceptually, it introduces a new idea: that instead of asking the sun to save us, we’re going to save ourselves.</p>
<p>In orchestrating this song, it is important not to let it get too militant or hopeful. That would turn it into a Song of Dawn, and step on Brighter Than Today’s toes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmKx-NQ6iWU">NYC 2016 Performance</a> is on Youtube</p>
<p>This song is available for sale via bandcamp in <a href="https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/">all three albums</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8fRlZUDpmk">Bayesian Choir Performance</a> of this song is on Youtube.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Sun barely rising a-bove the hor-izon<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
 Flowers are withering, naked bark brittle oh, Flowers are withering, naked bark brittle oh,<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
 Good folk are gonna die, sun-god ain't shedding tears<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
And I just stare at the sky, digging the graves each year<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
 Sun, sailing a - way I don't know<br>
 Where... I don’t know why…<br>
 Sky, darkening grey, wishing there<br>
 weren’t so man-y good - byes...<br>
 little one, little one why...<br>
 little one why...<br>
<br>
 Maybe if we looked a while and found a stone<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
 Dragged it a hun-der-ed miles and got it home<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
We could dig us a henge, raise those bluestones up high<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
In two hundred years we could look at the sky<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
Our children would know when the winter was coming, oh<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
 Looking and laboring, doing what must be done<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
 Sun, sailing a - way I don't know<br>
 Where... I don’t know why…<br>
 Sky, darkening grey, wishing there<br>
 weren’t so man-y good - byes...<br>
<br>
And maybe some good folk are still going to die<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
Their mothers shake helpless with rage and denial<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
But maybe it might be less deep of a sorrow<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
 Not quite so many graves dug up tomorrow<br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
</p>
