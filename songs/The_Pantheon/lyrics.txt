Gods ain't gonna help ya son
You'll be sorry for whatcha done

Them gods gonna hurt ya son
When you play with a loaded gun
When you play with a loaded gun

They ain't gonna catch you when you fall
You'll be pleadin' while you're bleedin'

They ain't gonna heal ya son
Don't care about whatcha done

They ain't gonna help ya son
You'll be sorry for whatcha done
Be sorry for what you done

Old Pyth, cranky old bull,
Make you sorry for whatcha done
Hense in a black veil
Gonna prick ya for whatcha done
Roathus gotcha empty
Gotcha weepin' for whatcha done
Micia Mother
Lonely old gal
Tear your heart out for whatcha done
Tear your heart out for whatcha done

They ain't gonna catch you when you fall
You'll be pleadin' while you're bleedin'

Gods ain't gonna help ya son
You'll be sorry for whatcha done

Them gods gonna hurt ya son
You'll be sorry for whatcha done
You'll be sorry for whatcha done
