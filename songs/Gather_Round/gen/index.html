<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Gather round, gather round, gather found my fire, stranger<br>
 Huddle up and  hunker down and pass that bowl around... yeah!<br>
 Gather round, gather round, gather found my fire, stranger<br>
 Huddle up and  hunker down and pass that bowl around<br>
 Out there we got hungry lions  (gather round, gather round)<br>
 Hundred other ways of dyin'    (gather round, gather round)<br>
 In here we got dinner fryin'   (gather round, gather round)<br>
 Gather round, come gather round the fire<br>
Now sing around, sing around, sing around the fire, neighbor<br>
 Breath in deep &amp; feel the beat &amp; make some bloody sound, yeah!<br>
 Sing around, sing around, sing around the fire, neighbor<br>
 Breath in deep &amp; feel the beat &amp; make some bloody sound, yeah!<br>
 You look like you been some places! (sing around, sing around)<br>
 Trouble's etched upon your face, yeah, (sing around, sing around)<br>
 Take that trouble,   shout it loud! Sing around, sing around<br>
 Take that trouble,   sing it round the fire<br>
Now dance around,  dance around, let's dance around the fire, together<br>
 Stand up straight &amp; gy-r-te and    shake your body round<br>
 Dance around,  dance around, come dance around the fire, together<br>
 Stand up straight &amp; gy-r-ate and   shake your body round<br>
 Out there we got  winter going, (dance around, dance around)<br>
 Bones all soaked the snow is blowin'   (dance around, dance around)<br>
But feel that heat and blood flowin'   (dance around, dance around)<br>
 Feel it flowin', dancing round the fire<br>
Now gather round, gather round, come gather found our fire, together<br>
 Huddle up and  hunker down and pass that bowl around... yeah!<br>
 Gather round, gather round, gather found our fire, together<br>
 Huddle up and  hunker down and pass that bowl aro-ound<br>
 Huddle up and  hunker down and pass that bowl around<br>
