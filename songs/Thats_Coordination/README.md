# That's Coordination
## A riff on That's Cooperation from Sesame Street.

This song is originally sung by Big Bird, with some modifications made for the rationalist set.

The original Sesame Street song can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kihZUsADQTQ).

A recording from DC Solstice 2024 is available [here](../Thats_Coordination_DC_2024.mp3). We also produced [sheet music](../Thats_Coordination.pdf).

For DC Solstice 2024, we introduced the song with:

> The next song was originally sung by Big Bird about working together to achieve a common goal. We’ve changed it up just a bit, but it’s still basically the same idea.
