<h2 id="a-riff-on-thats-cooperation-from-sesame-street.">A riff on That’s Cooperation from Sesame Street.</h2>
<p>This song is originally sung by Big Bird, with some modifications made for the rationalist set.</p>
<p>The original Sesame Street song can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kihZUsADQTQ">here</a>.</p>
<p>A recording from DC Solstice 2024 is available <a href="../Thats_Coordination_DC_2024.mp3">here</a>. We also produced <a href="../Thats_Coordination.pdf">sheet music</a>.</p>
<p>For DC Solstice 2024, we introduced the song with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next song was originally sung by Big Bird about working together to achieve a common goal. We’ve changed it up just a bit, but it’s still basically the same idea.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
A wise old nerd once told me<br>
And I believe it’s true<br>
He said the world’s full of different tribes with different points of view<br>
But sometimes there’s a job so big if we want to get it done<br>
We have to get those folks together and all work as one<br>
And that’s cooperation<br>
<br>
Coop! Coop! Cooperation!<br>
Coop! Coop! Cooperation!<br>
With just a little cooperation, we can make it through, me and you<br>
Coop! Coop! Cooperation!<br>
<br>
But just cooperation<br>
Won’t always be enough<br>
Sometimes we meet defectors who make things awfully tough<br>
So to keep our system working<br>
And make it more robust<br>
We'll align selfish incentives...<br>
… to create greater trust!<br>
AND THAT’S… COORDINATION.<br>
With quite a lot of coordination, we can muddle through, me and you<br>
<br>
Oh it doesn’t matter whether<br>
We’re birds of a different feather<br>
As long as when the right time comes<br>
We’re ready to act together<br>
(That’s coordination)<br>
<br>
Coord! Coord! Coordination!<br>
Coord! Coord! Coordination!<br>
With quite a lot of coordination, we can make it through, me and you<br>
Me and you<br>
