A wise old nerd once told me
And I believe it’s true
He said the world’s full of different tribes with different points of view
But sometimes there’s a job so big if we want to get it done
We have to get those folks together and all work as one
And that’s cooperation

Coop! Coop! Cooperation!
Coop! Coop! Cooperation!
With just a little cooperation, we can make it through, me and you
Coop! Coop! Cooperation!

But just cooperation
Won’t always be enough
Sometimes we meet defectors who make things awfully tough
So to keep our system working
And make it more robust
We'll align selfish incentives...
… to create greater trust!
AND THAT’S… COORDINATION.
With quite a lot of coordination, we can muddle through, me and you

Oh it doesn’t matter whether
We’re birds of a different feather
As long as when the right time comes
We’re ready to act together
(That’s coordination)

Coord! Coord! Coordination!
Coord! Coord! Coordination!
With quite a lot of coordination, we can make it through, me and you
Me and you
