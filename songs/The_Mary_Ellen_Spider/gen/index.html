<p>This is a parody of Mary Ellen Carter, a bit sillier and with even less subtext. Various versions of this exist, with the earliest I (Skyler) am aware of being Tom Smith’s version <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn4xmAwkcFs">on youtube</a>. Sometimes this is called Eensie Weensie Spider, but there’s a different song sometimes using that title.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
The eensie-weensie spider went up the water spout<br>
Down came the rain and washed the spider out<br>
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain<br>
And the eensie-weensie spider climbed again<br>
<br>
She wouldn't let the elements distract her from her goal;<br>
The purpose of her struggle was embedded in her soul.<br>
Now, see the sun shine down on beasts, on women and on men<br>
And like the eensie-weensie spider, rise again!<br>
<br>
Rise again, rise again!<br>
She will not let misfortune keep her from doing what she can,<br>
So whether your legs number two, or four, or eight, or ten,<br>
Be like that eensie-weensie spider, rise again!<br>
<br>
This eensie weensie metaphor's a lesson for us all -<br>
We cannot be defeated if we rise each time we fall,<br>
And if you think this story's one you learned too long ago,<br>
Then think about some other ones you know.<br>
<br>
You know the myth of Sisyphus, and you know Jack and Jill<br>
It's such a potent image going up and down a hill,<br>
So every time you fall, or lose a lover or a friend,<br>
Be like that eensie-weensie spider: Rise again!<br>
<br>
Rise again, rise again!<br>
She will not let misfortune keep her from doing what she can,<br>
So whether your legs number two, or four, or eight, or ten,<br>
Be like that eensie-weensie spider, rise again!<br>
<br>
Perhaps you think this allegory goes a bit too far<br>
Climbing up a pipe is not like reaching for a star<br>
But whether its's a water spout or mountain that you climb<br>
You've come this far; indulge me one more time.<br>
<br>
It could be said that each of us climbs up a water spout.<br>
The downward pull of gravity is not what it's about:<br>
The upward pull of hope is what will save us in the end.<br>
Be like that eensie-weensie spider: Rise again!<br>
<br>
Rise again, Rise again!<br>
Never let misfortune keep your from doing what you can,<br>
And whether your legs number two, or four, or eight, or ten,<br>
Be like the eensie-weensie spider: Rise again!<br>
