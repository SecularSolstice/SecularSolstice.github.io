# The Mary Ellen Spider
## by Stan Rogers (tune) and Bob Blue (lyrics)
## A metaphor of persistance

This is a parody of Mary Ellen Carter, a bit sillier and with even less subtext. Various versions of this exist, with the earliest I (Skyler) am aware of being Tom Smith's version [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn4xmAwkcFs). Sometimes this is called Eensie Weensie Spider, but there's a different song sometimes using that title.
