Once upon a time, 
You could hear the Saturn's roar
As it rose upon it's fiery tail to space.
And once upon a time, the men that we sent out
Landed in a strange and alien place.
And as I watched them walk upon the Moon, 
I remembered Icarus, 
Who flew too close to the Sun.

Once upon a time, they tore the gantries down
And the rockets flew no longer to the Moon.
And once upon a time, 
We swore that we'd return, 
But it doesn't look like we'll be back there soon

And as the Moon shines down
On the shattered launching ground, 
I remember Apollo, 
Who flew the chariot of the Sun.
And I wonder of the legends they will tell
A thousand years from now.
