# Space Oddity
## By David Bowie
## A confused account of going into space

An outside song.  [Original music video is on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYYRH4apXDo).  As is a [music video made *on* the ISS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo).  [Lyrics are also available](https://genius.com/David-bowie-space-oddity-lyrics)

Many refer to this song as  "Ground Control to Major Tom" after its opening lyric, but Space Oddity is the correct title.
