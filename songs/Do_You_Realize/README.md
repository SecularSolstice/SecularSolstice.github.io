#  Do You Realize
## By The Flaming Lips
## A surreal song of love and death

This one doesn't reward deep intellectual probing, but the themes of
love, death, astronomy and hidden truth that recur in it all fit
solstice well.  Also, it does a really good job of pulling people back
into a dark headspace after intermission.

The [official music
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPXWt2ESxVY) is available.  Our
performances are more mournful and less psychedelic.

A [Bayesian Choir Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQKskwd6b2A) of this song is on Youtube.
