<h2 id="a-surreal-song-of-love-and-death">A surreal song of love and death</h2>
<p>This one doesn’t reward deep intellectual probing, but the themes of love, death, astronomy and hidden truth that recur in it all fit solstice well. Also, it does a really good job of pulling people back into a dark headspace after intermission.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPXWt2ESxVY">official music video</a> is available. Our performances are more mournful and less psychedelic.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQKskwd6b2A">Bayesian Choir Performance</a> of this song is on Youtube.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Do you realize....          that you have the most beautiful face<br>
 Do you realize...           we're floating in space<br>
 Do you realize...           that happiness... makes you cry<br>
 Do you realize...           that everyone... you know... someday... will die<br>
 And instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know you<br>
 realize that life goes fast. It's hard to make the good things last.<br>
 You realize the sun don't go down. It's just an illusion caused by the world, spinning round<br>
 Do you realize... ah ah ahhh.... ah ah ahhh... ah ahhh..<br>
 Do you realize...           that you have the most beautiful face...<br>
 Do you realize...           we're floating in space<br>
 Do you realize...           that happiness makes you cry<br>
 Do you realize...           that everyone... you know... someday... will die<br>
 And instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know you<br>
 You realize that life goes fast. It's hard to make the good things last.<br>
 You realize the sun don't go down. It's just an illusion caused by the world, spinning round<br>
 Do you realize...           that everyone... you know... someday... will die<br>
