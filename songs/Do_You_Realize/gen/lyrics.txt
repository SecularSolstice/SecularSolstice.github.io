 Do you realize...           we're floating in space
 Do you realize...           that happiness... makes you cry
 Do you realize...           that everyone... you know... someday... will die
 And instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know you
 realize that life goes fast. It's hard to make the good things last.
 You realize the sun don't go down. It's just an illusion caused by the world, spinning round
 Do you realize... ah ah ahhh.... ah ah ahhh... ah ahhh..
 Do you realize...           that you have the most beautiful face...
 Do you realize...           we're floating in space
 Do you realize...           that happiness makes you cry
 Do you realize...           that everyone... you know... someday... will die
 And instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know you
 You realize that life goes fast. It's hard to make the good things last.
 You realize the sun don't go down. It's just an illusion caused by the world, spinning round
 Do you realize...           that everyone... you know... someday... will die
