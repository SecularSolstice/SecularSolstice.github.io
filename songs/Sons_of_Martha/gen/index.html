<p>Astute fans of the poem will notice I’ve dropped two stanzas. It’s
still almost five minutes, so I really don’t think we want longer. More
astute fans will note I’ve re-ordered two more, because the poem has a
subtle a-b-a-b-a-b pattern in its stanzas and the two I dropped were
three apart. The most astute fans will notice I moved the final “and”
from the end of the penultimate line to the beginning of the ultimate
one. From a poetic perspective, it hardly matters, but musically we want
to draw out tension before the punchline.</p>
<p>Those who are <em>not</em> fans of the poem may be a bit lost. The
original Christian story is a bit obscure, and the Old Money vs People
Who Work dichotomy is somewhat more a thing of Kipling’s time than ours.
And the connection between them is either pure Kipling or otherwise lost
to time.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  The Sons of Mary seldom bother,<br>
  for they have inherited that good part;<br>
  But the Sons of Martha favour their Mother<br>
  of the careful soul and the troubled heart.<br>
  And because she lost her temper once, and<br>
  because she was rude to the Lord her Guest,<br>
  Her Sons must wait upon Mary’s Sons,<br>
  world without end, reprieve, or rest.<br>
<br>
  It is their care in all the ages<br>
  to take the buffet and cushion the shock.<br>
  It is their care that the gear engages;<br>
  it is their care that the switches lock.<br>
  It is their care that the wheels run truly;<br>
  it is their care to embark and entrain,<br>
  Tally, transport, and deliver duly<br>
  the Sons of Mary by land and main.<br>
<br>
  They say to mountains, ”Be ye removed”<br>
  They say to the lesser floods ”Be dry.”<br>
  Under their rods are the rocks reproved;<br>
  they are not afraid of that which is high.<br>
  Then do the hill tops shake to the summit;<br>
  then is the bed of the deep laid bare,<br>
  That the Sons of Mary may overcome it,<br>
  pleasantly sleeping and unaware.<br>
<br>
  They do not preach that their God will rouse them<br>
  a little before the nuts work loose.<br>
  They do not teach that His Pity allows them<br>
  to leave their job when they damn well choose.<br>
  As in the thronged and the lighted ways,<br>
  so in the dark and the desert they stand,<br>
  Wary and watchful all their days<br>
  that their brethren’s days may be long in the land.<br>
<br>
  To these from birth is Belief forbidden;<br>
  from these till death is Relief afar.<br>
  They are concerned with matters hidden;<br>
  under the earthline their altars are<br>
  The secret fountains to follow up,<br>
  waters withdrawn to restore to the mouth,<br>
  And gather the floods as in a cup,<br>
  and pour them again at a city’s drouth.<br>
<br>
  And the Sons of Mary smile and are blessed;<br>
  they know the angels are on their side.<br>
  They know in them is the Grace confessed,<br>
  and for them are the Mercies multiplied.<br>
  They sit at the Feet; they hear the Word;<br>
  they see how truly the Promise runs.<br>
  They have cast their burden upon the Lord,<br>
  and the Lord He lays it on Martha’s Sons!<br>
