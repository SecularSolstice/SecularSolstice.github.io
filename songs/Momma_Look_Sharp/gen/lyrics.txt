Momma, hey momma
Come lookin' for me
I'm here in the meadow
By the red maple tree

Momma, hey momma
Look sharp, here I be
Hey, hey
Momma, look sharp

Them soldiers, they fired
Oh, ma, did we run
But then we turned 'round
And the battle begun

Then I went under
Oh, ma, am I done?
Hey, hey
Momma, look sharp

My eyes are wide open
My face to the sky
Is that you I'm hearin'
In the tall grass nearby?

Momma, come find me
Before I do die
Hey, hey
Momma, look sharp

I'll close your eyes, my Billy
Them eyes that cannot see
And I'll bury ya, my Billy
Beneath the maple tree

And never again
Will you whisper to me
Hey, hey
Oh, Momma, look sharp
