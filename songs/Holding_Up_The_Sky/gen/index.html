<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  This game: it used to be fun<br>
  To watch the clouds in the sky<br>
  And see in each fluffy one<br>
  The bunny or fortress passed by<br>
  To name for each castle and whale<br>
  The cobblers and kings living there<br>
  To tell a whimsical tale<br>
  Of people who dwell in the air<br>
  But as those same tales take their wings<br>
  The power of names stretches forth<br>
  And soon all those cobblers and kings<br>
  Have their own lives of meaning and worth<br>
<br>
  So there's only...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Holding up the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Still holding up the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    To crawl so men may fly<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Each step to verify<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Though decades may pass by<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Always holding up the sky<br>
<br>
  To yearn for rest and still ask why<br>
  To heed what toil and pain have found:<br>
  Who'd build a castle in the sky<br>
  Must plant the feet on solid ground.<br>
  To test and test each strand and curl,<br>
  Anticipate how wind may blow,<br>
  To know with fear the wide strange world,<br>
  And little trust what lore you know.<br>
<br>
  So you can be...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Holding up the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Still holding up the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    To crawl so men may fly<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Each step to verify<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Though decades may pass by<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Always holding up the sky<br>
<br>
  To hold like kin those too who bear<br>
  A fellow cloud or solar ray.<br>
  To leave the future warnings clear<br>
  Of all you wish you'd known today..<br>
  To keenly spot and stoutly face<br>
  The worms that lurk beneath the deep.<br>
  To know and choose when to let fall<br>
  A flake of snow you cannot keep.<br>
<br>
  And you will be...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Holding up the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Still holding up the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    To crawl so men may fly<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Each step to verify<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Though decades may pass by<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Always holding up the sky<br>
<br>
  There once was a dream of the youth<br>
  And a game that children could play<br>
  What remains is a glorious truth<br>
  Is that such a high price to pay?<br>
