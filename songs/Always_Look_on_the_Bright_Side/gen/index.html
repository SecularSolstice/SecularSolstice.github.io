<p>We’ve generally opened with this one. It has the advantage that everyone knows it. It also foreshadows all the dark elements of the Solstice while being bright and silly itself.</p>
<p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHPOzQzk9Qo">the original video</a> for a sense of the idea and the sound.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Some things in life are bad they can really make you mad<br>
Other things just make you swear and curse<br>
When you've chewing an life's gristle, Don't grumble give a whistle<br>
And this'll help things turn out for the best<br>
<br>
And always look on the bright side of life<br>
Always look on the light side of life<br>
<br>
If life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten<br>
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.<br>
When you've feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps<br>
Just purse your lips and whistle -- that's the thing<br>
<br>
And always look on the bright side of life<br>
Come on always look on the bright side of life<br>
<br>
For life is quite absurd and death's the final word<br>
you must always face the curtain with a bow<br>
Forget about your sin -- give the audience a grin<br>
Enjoy it -- it's your last chance anyhow.<br>
<br>
So always look on the bright side of death<br>
just before you draw your terminal breath<br>
<br>
Life's a piece of spit when you look at it<br>
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true<br>
You'll see it's all a show -- keep'em laughing as you go<br>
just remember that the last laugh is on you<br>
<br>
And always look on the bright side of life<br>
Always look on the right side of life<br>
And always look on the bright side of life<br>
Always look on the right side of life (retardando)<br>
