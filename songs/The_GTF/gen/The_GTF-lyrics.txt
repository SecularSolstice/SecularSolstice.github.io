One evening as the sun went down
That big old fire was wasteful,
A coder looked up from his work,
And he said, “Folks, that’s distasteful,
But in another twenty years
With some big old computer
You and I will flourish in
The Great Transhumanist Future.

In the Great Transhumanist Future,
There are worlds all fair and bright,
We’ll be constrained by nothing but
The latency of light
When the hospitals are empty
And the sun’s a battery
Making it a breeze
To get outta deep freeze
To give humans wings
And some other things
In the Great Transhumanist Future.

In the Great Transhumanist Future,
You never have to sleep
Run forks on computronium
And speed them up for cheap
The galaxy is full of stars
And the world is full of space
Oh I long to see
An eternity
Spreading far and wide
And we’re all carefree
In the Great Transhumanist Future.

In the Great Transhumanist Future,
You never go without
And giant streams of data
Are flowing all about
There’s a cure for your depression
And a fix for all badbrains
There’s a trillion years
With immortal peers
All the people who are working
Are volunteers
In the Great Transhumanist Future.

In the Great Transhumanist Future,
We learn all about the world
Physics, math, psychology
Are suddenly unfurled
You can see a billion colors
You can hear just like a bat
Hope I live to go
Where we get to grow
Give me VR porn
And a unicorn
In the Great Transhumanist Future!

I'll see you nigh
If we don't die
In the Great Transhumanist Future!
