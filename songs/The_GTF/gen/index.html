<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
One evening as the sun went down<br>
That big old fire was wasteful,<br>
A coder looked up from his work,<br>
And he said, “Folks, that’s distasteful,<br>
But in another twenty years<br>
With some big old computer<br>
You and I will flourish in<br>
The Great Transhumanist Future.<br>
<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future,<br>
There are worlds all fair and bright,<br>
We’ll be constrained by nothing but<br>
The latency of light<br>
When the hospitals are empty<br>
And the sun’s a battery<br>
Making it a breeze<br>
To get outta deep freeze<br>
To give humans wings<br>
And some other things<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future.<br>
<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future,<br>
You never have to sleep<br>
Run forks on computronium<br>
And speed them up for cheap<br>
The galaxy is full of stars<br>
And the world is full of space<br>
Oh I long to see<br>
An eternity<br>
Spreading far and wide<br>
And we’re all carefree<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future.<br>
<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future,<br>
You never go without<br>
And giant streams of data<br>
Are flowing all about<br>
There’s a cure for your depression<br>
And a fix for all badbrains<br>
There’s a trillion years<br>
With immortal peers<br>
All the people who are working<br>
Are volunteers<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future.<br>
<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future,<br>
We learn all about the world<br>
Physics, math, psychology<br>
Are suddenly unfurled<br>
You can see a billion colors<br>
You can hear just like a bat<br>
Hope I live to go<br>
Where we get to grow<br>
Give me VR porn<br>
And a unicorn<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future!<br>
<br>
I'll see you nigh<br>
If we don't die<br>
In the Great Transhumanist Future!<br>
</p>
