Previous discussion about this song:

**Daniel:**

> If it's literal, it's not clear how it applies. If it's metaphorical, it's not clear for what. I've always seen it as about Moloch: how even the absentee owner of the woods, how even the *horse*, can't imagine putting aside their livelihoods long enough to watch the beauty of nature for five minutes, and even the narrator can spare only that. But that's not a theme we touch on much elsewhere in Solstice. And other people interpret it differently. And in a community that tries to cultivate the habit of seeing things for what they are, and *not* pushing our own interpretations onto them, this is a problem.

**Raymond:**

> I personally consider it a weakness/failing of the rationalist community that we don't get / freak out about metaphors. I'd personally prefer to resolve the issue by tweaking Solstice to introduce the idea of metaphors earlier in the thing so that people can appreciate Stopping in the Woods when it happens. 
>
> I'm not sure if that'd work though and I think reasonable people can disagree on the right approach

**Daniel:**

>  I think "metaphors" would benefit from some breaking down. Moloch and bayesjitsu are metaphors, and we're fine with those. Brighter Than Today doesn't try to be historically accurate and no one objects.
> 
> So what's different about Stopping By Woods? I think it's the ambiguity. My understanding of it is completely different from yours. And neither is the view of the literary hive mind. It's enough to make one suspect that the poem has no meaning beyond the mundane: this was a moment Frost wanted to share, and everything will else is being read into it by active readers.
> 
> Refusing to read things into other things can be a good habit. One I'd be reluctant to push against.

**Raymond:**

>  think my point is that being *inable* to read into things is a bad habit - it's good that most of the Solstice says clear things on purpose, but I don't think it's good to not be *able* to read your own interpretation in an ambiguous poem - there are failure modes associated with it but it's a perfectly reasonable human thing to do. (There are also people who don't like that Solstice is so explicit and Stopping in the Wood is basically the only one thrown their way)
>
> I think the core, important interpretation of Stopping in the Woods is also actually pretty literal: imagine that you, in particular, are stopping in the middle of the woods on the darkest night of the year and have miles to go before you sleep. What would you, in particular, be thinking about while that happened?

We never really resolved this.  But whatever you think of the words, the melody is beuatifully haunting.
