    <h1>Stopping In The Woods Chord Chart</h1>
<h2>Stopping in the Woods</h2>
<h2>By Robert Frost</h2>
<h2>Whose woods these are I think I know.</h2>
<h2>His house is in the village though;</h2>
<h2>He will not see me stopping here</h2>
<h2>To watch his woods fill up with snow.</h2>
<h2>My little horse must think it queer</h2>
<h2>To stop without a farmhouse near</h2>
<h2>Between the woods and frozen lake</h2>
<h2>The darkest evening of the year.</h2>
