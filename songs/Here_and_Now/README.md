#  Here and Now
## By Raymond Arnold
## A celebration of now

There'd be a certain logic in updating this song regularly, but
somehow it doesn't seem to need it.

Except for the Star Wars bit.  This song appeared alongside Force
awakens, hence "Brand new Star Wars out tonight" was a pretty exciting
thing.  We kept the lyric for Rogue One, mostly because reusing it
amused us.  The third time we met a week early, so "deeper truthes to
seek / brand new Star Wars out next week."  But Solo was neither
song-worthy nor released in december, so cookies instead.  The ability
to summon cookies late at night is a triumph of modern civilization
that we will never tire of. 

This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the [2015](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2015) album.

A live NYC2019 recording is in the Files section.
