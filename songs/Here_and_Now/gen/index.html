<p>There’d be a certain logic in updating this song regularly, but somehow it doesn’t seem to need it.</p>
<p>Except for the Star Wars bit. This song appeared alongside Force awakens, hence “Brand new Star Wars out tonight” was a pretty exciting thing. We kept the lyric for Rogue One, mostly because reusing it amused us. The third time we met a week early, so “deeper truthes to seek / brand new Star Wars out next week.” But Solo was neither song-worthy nor released in december, so cookies instead. The ability to summon cookies late at night is a triumph of modern civilization that we will never tire of.</p>
<p>Another update, “Elon’s colonizing mars” -&gt; “Predict with swift robust bazaars”. Because Manifold’s gotten useful despite its play-money, and Elon keeps doing things that make him less fun to sing about. One might sing “liquid” instead of “robust”, which has more substance but is kind of hard to sing.</p>
<p>This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the <a href="https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2015">2015</a> album.</p>
<p>A live NYC2019 recording is in the Files section.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Grandma told me   stories...  'bout life from way back when<br>
 Walking uphill both ways through the snow.<br>
 Rugged people trudging down the narrow path   a - head<br>
 Going where their dad-dy said  to  go<br>
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby<br>
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but<br>
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some<br>
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for?<br>
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  choices all a - round<br>
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   we got interest com - pound...ing.<br>
 Taking things for granted that'd shatter Newton's mind<br>
What'll we find in to -   morrow's here and now<br>
<br>
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby<br>
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but<br>
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some<br>
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for?<br>
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  pens instead of swords<br>
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   turning ploughshares into tractors<br>
 Taking things for granted, super- stim-u-lus ga - lore<br>
What's in store for to -   morrow's here and now now<br>
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby<br>
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but<br>
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some<br>
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for?<br>
Here and now... here and    now... (here and now... here and  now...)<br>
Here and now... here and    now... (here and now... here and  now...)<br>
Here and now... here and   now...    we got  smallpox locked up tight<br>
Here and  now... here and  now...   Summon cookies late at night!<br>
Here and  now... here and  now...   gotta run and catch my flight<br>
But I'll see you in  to-  morrow's here and now now<br>
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  robots driving  cars<br>
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   Predict with swift robust ba- zaars<br>
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   we got smart philanthro-py<br>
With some sci-en-tific   rigor and some   met-a-na-ly - ses. Yeah!<br>
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby<br>
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but<br>
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some<br>
 Riddles to  un - ravel...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
 for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
 for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
 for...<br>
