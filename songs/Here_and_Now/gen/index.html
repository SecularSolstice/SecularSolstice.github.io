<p>There’d be a certain logic in updating this song regularly, but
somehow it doesn’t seem to need it.</p>
<p>Except for the Star Wars bit. This song appeared alongside Force
awakens, hence “Brand new Star Wars out tonight” was a pretty exciting
thing. We kept the lyric for Rogue One, mostly because reusing it amused
us. The third time we met a week early, so “deeper truthes to seek /
brand new Star Wars out next week.” But Solo was neither song-worthy nor
released in december, so cookies instead. The ability to summon cookies
late at night is a triumph of modern civilization that we will never
tire of.</p>
<p>Another update, “Elon’s colonizing mars” -&gt; “Predict with swift
robust bazaars”. Because Manifold’s gotten useful despite its
play-money, and Elon keeps doing things that make him less fun to sing
about. One might sing “liquid” instead of “robust”, which has more
substance but is kind of hard to sing.</p>
<p>Update 2024: “Gotta run and catch my flight” -&gt; “Our AIDS
prevention works all right”. Not because flying has gotten much worse
but because <a
href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407001">blocking AIDS
transmission 100% with a single implant</a> is worth celebrating with
rhetorical understatement. Then swapped the order of this and the
cookies so the humorously minor accomplishment can go last.</p>
<p>This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the <a
href="https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2015">2015</a>
album.</p>
<p>A live NYC2019 recording is in the Files section.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Grandma told me   stories...  'bout life from way back when<br>
 Walking uphill both ways through the snow.<br>
 Rugged people trudging down the narrow path   a - head<br>
 Going where their dad-dy said  to  go<br>
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby<br>
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but<br>
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some<br>
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for?<br>
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  choices all a - round<br>
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   we got interest com - pound...ing.<br>
 Taking things for granted that'd shatter Newton's mind<br>
What'll we find in to -   morrow's here and now<br>
<br>
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby<br>
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but<br>
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some<br>
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for?<br>
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  pens instead of swords<br>
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   turning ploughshares into tractors<br>
 Taking things for granted, super- stim-u-lus ga - lore<br>
What's in store for to -   morrow's here and now now<br>
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby<br>
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but<br>
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some<br>
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for?<br>
Here and now... here and    now... (here and now... here and  now...)<br>
Here and now... here and    now... (here and now... here and  now...)<br>
Here and now... here and   now...    we got  smallpox locked up tight<br>
Here and  now... here and  now...   Our AIDS  prevention works all right<br>
Here and  now... here and  now...   Summon cookies late at night!<br>
But I'll see you in  to-  morrow's here and now now<br>
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  robots driving  cars<br>
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   Predict with swift robust ba- zaars<br>
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   we got smart philanthro-py<br>
With some sci-en-tific   rigor and some   met-a-na-ly - ses. Yeah!<br>
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby<br>
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but<br>
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some<br>
 Riddles to  un - ravel...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
 for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
 for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
 for...<br>
