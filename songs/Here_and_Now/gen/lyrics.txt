 Walking uphill both ways through the snow.  
 Rugged people trudging down the narrow path   a - head 
 Going where their dad-dy said  to  go   
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby 
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but 
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for? 
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  choices all a - round 
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   we got interest com - pound...ing. 
 Taking things for granted that'd shatter Newton's mind 
What'll we find in to -   morrow's here and now 
    
    
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby 
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but 
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for? 
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  pens instead of swords 
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   turning ploughshares into tractors 
 Taking things for granted, super- stim-u-lus ga - lore 
What's in store for to -   morrow's here and now now 
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby 
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but 
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   
 Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for? 
Here and now... here and    now... (here and now... here and  now...)    
Here and now... here and    now... (here and now... here and  now...)    
Here and now... here and   now...    we got  smallpox locked up tight 
Here and  now... here and  now...   Summon cookies late at night! 
Here and  now... here and  now...   gotta run and catch my flight  
See 'em   play out  in  to-  morrow's here and now now 
Here and now... here and  now...    we got  robots driving  cars
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   Elon's col-o-ni-zing Mars
Here and now... here and  now...     now...   we got smart philanthro-py 
With some sci-en-tific   rigor and some   met-a-na-ly - ses. Yeah! 
 Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby 
 Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but 
 Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   
 Riddles to  un - ravel...  ...    tell me   what you waiting
 for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting
 for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting
 for...
