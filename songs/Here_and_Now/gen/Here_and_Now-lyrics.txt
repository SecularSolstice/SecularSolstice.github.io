Grandma told me stories – about life from way back when
Walking uphill both ways through the snow
Rugged people trudgin' down the narrow path ahead
Going where their daddy said to go

Way back when... everything seemed simple, baby
Some day soon… maybe it'll all make sense again
But here and now, got a world to explore,
Got some riddles to unravel, baby
What you waiting for?

Here and now, here and now…. We got choices all around
Here and now, here and now…. We got interest compounding
Taking things for granted that’d shatter Newton's mind,
What'll we find in tomorrow's here and now?

Way back when... everything seemed simple, baby
Some day soon… maybe it'll all make sense again
But here and now, got a world to explore,
Got some riddles to unravel, baby
What you waiting for?

Here and now, here and now…. we got pens instead of swords,
Here and now, here and now… turning ploughshares into tract-ors
Taking things for granted, superstimulus galore,
What's in store for tomorrow's here and now?

Way back when... everything seemed simple, baby
Some day soon… maybe it'll all make sense again
But here and now, got a world to explore,
Got some riddles to unravel, baby
What'chu waiting for?

Here and now, here and now (Here and now, here and now)
Here and now, here and now (Here and now, here and now)

Here and now... here and now... We got smallpox locked up tight
Here and now... here and now... Our AIDS prevention works all right
Here and now... here and now... Summon cookies late at night!
Here and now, here and now... gotta run and catch my flight
But I'll see you in tomorrow's here and now.

Here and now, here and now… we got robots driving cars
Here and now, here and now… Predict with swift robust bazaars
Here and now, here and now…  We got smart philanthropy
With some scientific rigor and some metanalyses. Yeah!

Way back when... everything seemed simple, baby
Some day soon… maybe it'll all make sense again
But here and now, got a world to explore,
Got some riddles to unravel...

Tell me what you waiting for
