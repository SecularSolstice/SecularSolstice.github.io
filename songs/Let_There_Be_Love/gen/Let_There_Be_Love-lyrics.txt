  Though all our kind may die some day,
  Let there be love.
  Though flesh and steel erode a --way,
  Though heavy be the price to pay,
  Let there be love.

  Let there be a love of beauty.
  Let there be a love of truth.
  Let there be a love for mentors.
  Let there be a love for youth.

  Let there be a love of justice.
  Let there be a love of love.
  Let there be a love for strangers,
  And for those our tribe is of.

  Though every star grow dim and cold,
  Let there be love.
  Though anger last an age untold,
  Though fear-of-death itself wane old,
  Let there be love.

  Let each carbon form an axon; let it love.
  Let each ion cross a membrane; let it love.
  Let the silicon and copper form a circuit with each other; let them love.
  Let them be loved.

  Let each photon bridge a distance; let it love.
  Let neutrinos form a network; let them love.
  Let the yet  unnammed dark matter find a way to flirt and chatter; let it love.
  Let it be loved.

  As we grow into our power,
  Let us love.
  At anthropocene's first hour,
  As our works begin to flower,
  Let us love.

  Here we stand with our ambition;
  At this beginning we all say:
  Let there be love!
