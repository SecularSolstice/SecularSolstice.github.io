<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Another head hangs lowly<br>
Child is slowly taken<br>
<br>
And the violence,<br>
caused such silence<br>
Who are we mistaken<br>
<br>
But you see, it's not me<br>
It's not my family<br>
In your head, in your head,<br>
they are fighting<br>
<br>
With their tanks,<br>
and their bombs<br>
And their bombs,<br>
and their guns<br>
In your head, in your head<br>
they are crying<br>
<br>
In your head, in your head<br>
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br>
What's in your head,<br>
in your head<br>
Zombie, zombie,<br>
zombie-ie-ie, oh<br>
<br>
(Du, du, du, du, du<br>
Du, du, du, du, du<br>
Du, du, du, du, du<br>
Du, du, du, du, du)<br>
<br>
Another mother's breaking<br>
Heart is taking over<br>
<br>
When the violence<br>
causes silence<br>
We must be mistaken<br>
<br>
It's the same old theme<br>
Since 1916<br>
<br>
In your head, in your head,<br>
they're still fighting<br>
With their tanks,<br>
and their bombs<br>
And their bombs,<br>
and their guns<br>
<br>
In your head, in your head,<br>
they are dying<br>
<br>
In your head, in your head<br>
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br>
What's in your head,<br>
in your head<br>
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br>
<br>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br>
oh, ay, oh, ya ya<br>
</p>
