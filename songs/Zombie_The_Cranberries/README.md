This song is about the [Warrington bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrington_bombings)
and [The Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles)
that they are part of.
It is about innocent people and children dying.

> **More than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were civilians,**
> 32% were members of the British security forces,
> and 16% were members of paramilitary groups.
