Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken

And the violence,
caused such silence
Who are we mistaken

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head,
they are fighting

With their tanks,
and their bombs
And their bombs,
and their guns
In your head, in your head
they are crying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head,
in your head
Zombie, zombie,
zombie-ie-ie, oh

(Du, du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du, du)

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over

When the violence
causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
Since 1916

In your head, in your head,
they're still fighting
With their tanks,
and their bombs
And their bombs,
and their guns

In your head, in your head,
they are dying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head,
in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh, ay, oh, ya ya
