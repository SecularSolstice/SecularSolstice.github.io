Somewhere, somewhere, the sky calls to us
The sky calls to us

If we do not destroy ourselves, then
We will someday venture
To the stars

Imagination will carry us to 
Worlds that never were, that never were
But without it, we would go nowhere

We make ourselves significant
By the courage of our questions
And the depth of our answers
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere

Somewhere, something incredible
Is waiting to be known
Somewhere, something incredible
Is waiting to be known

If we do not destroy ourselves
Then we will someday venture to the stars
