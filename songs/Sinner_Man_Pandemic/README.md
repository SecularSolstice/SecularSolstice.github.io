# Sinner Man: Pandemic
## By Nina Simone
## Everything failing in the face of a true pandemic

Based on the old spiritual [Sinner
Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH3Fx41Jpl4) about the
unrepentent on the day of judgement (the same one Babylon 5 used as
"And the rock cried out no hiding place", in a more upbeat, gospelish
arrangement).

The lyrics have been modified to be about a pandemic, in which
everything collapses and therefore no one can help you.  There exist
[some notes about the new lyrics](http://www.jefftk.com/p/sinner-man-pandemic).
