<p>To put this song in some historical context:</p>
<p>In 1968, Russian author Kir Bulychev began a series of scifi/adventure children’s books entitled <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceGirlFromTheFuture">Alice, Girl from the Future</a>. Set in the late 21st century, they depicted Earth as a high-tech communist utopia but the rest of the galaxy rather less so – hence adventure</p>
<p>In 1978, he wrote the fourth book: Alice in the Past, in which his hero traveled through time to the 20th century.</p>
<p>In 1984, Soviet Central Television converted this novel into a five-episode miniseries entitled <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuestFromTheFuture">Guest from the Future</a>. This was the theme song.</p>
<p>In 2018, Anna Tchetchetkine and the Bayesian Choir translated the song into English and arranged it for the choir.</p>
<p>The original can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJB_kRkwUOk">here</a></p>
<p>The 2020 Bayesian Choir performance is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S19KpxLSbwc">also on youtube</a>. The music for this arrangement is available in <a href="../Beautiful_Tomorrow_SATB_v1.4.pdf">pdf</a> and <a href="../Beautiful_Tomorrow_SATB_v1.4.mscz">MuseScore</a> format.</p>
<p>There is also an arrangement for a guitar and two vocalists (soprano and alto) available in <a href="../Beautiful_Tomorrow_duet.pdf">pdf</a> and <a href="../Beautiful_Tomorrow_duet.mscz">MuseScore</a> format.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2020/10-beautiful-tomorrow--2020-12-20-024637.mp3">A recording of this from the 2020 North American Distributed Chorus</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
I can hear tomorrow’s voice call out and lure me,<br>
In the silver dew, it rings out like a bell;<br>
And the path that stretches beckoning before me<br>
Makes me dizzy like a children’s carousel.<br>
<br>
O beautiful tomorrow, don’t lead me into sorrow,<br>
Be kind to me, tomorrow, don’t lead me astray;<br>
I’ll chart a course to follow to lead me to tomorrow,<br>
To beautiful tomorrow I start to make my way.<br>
<br>
I can hear tomorrow call me on a journey<br>
To a world of wondrous beauty, far away;<br>
I can hear it ask me urgently and sternly:<br>
For tomorrow’s sake what have I done today?<br>
<br>
O beautiful tomorrow, don’t lead me into sorrow,<br>
Be kind to me, tomorrow, don’t lead me astray;<br>
I’ll chart a course to follow to lead me to tomorrow,<br>
To beautiful tomorrow I start to make my way.<br>
<br>
Now I vow that I’ll be kinder and more honest<br>
And I’ll never leave a suff’ring friend behind;<br>
I am called for help and come as I have promised;<br>
I will blaze a trail if there’s no path to find.<br>
<br>
O beautiful tomorrow, don’t lead me into sorrow,<br>
Be kind to me, tomorrow, don’t lead me astray;<br>
I’ll chart a course to follow to lead me to tomorrow,<br>
To beautiful tomorrow I start to make my way.<br>
<br>
O beautiful tomorrow, don’t lead me into sorrow,<br>
Be kind to me, tomorrow, don’t lead me astray;<br>
I’ll chart a course to follow to lead me to tomorrow;<br>
<br>
To beautiful tomorrow ---<br>
 I start to make my way.<br>
