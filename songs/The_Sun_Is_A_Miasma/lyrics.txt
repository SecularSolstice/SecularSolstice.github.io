The sun is a miasma
Of incandescent plasma
The sun's not simply made out of gas
No, no, no

The sun is a quagmire
It's not made of fire
Forget what you've been told in the past

Electrons are free
(Plasma!) Fourth state of matter
Not gas, not liquid, not solid

The sun isn't a red dwarf
I hope it never morphs
Into a supernova'd collapsed orb
Orb, orb, orb

The sun is a miasma
Of incandescent plasma
I forget what I was told by myself
Elf, elf, elf

Electrons are free
(Plasma!) Fourth state of matter
Not gas, not liquid, not solid

Forget that song
(Plasma!) They got it wrong
That thesis has been rendered invalid
