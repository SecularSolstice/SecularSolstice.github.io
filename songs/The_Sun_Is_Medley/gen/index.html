<p>This is just the three other The Sun Is songs stitched together.</p>
<p>It ends kind of suddenly. Probably best to tag on some instrumental bit that conveys finality</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
The sun is a guy who travels through the sky, in a great big chariot of fire.<br>
It’s getting pretty dark, looking like he might depart, Leaving nothing but an everlasting night.<br>
<br>
The sun is bright, but quite a spiteful jerk sometimes we’ve found,<br>
But if we sacrifice some goats Maybe he’ll come around.<br>
<br>
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace.<br>
Where hydrogen makes helium at a temperature of millions of degrees<br>
<br>
The sun is hot, the sun is not a place where we could live.<br>
But here on earth there'd be no life without the light it gives.<br>
<br>
The sun is a miasma of incandescent plasma. The sun's simply not made out of gas. No! no! no!<br>
The sun can inspire, but it's not made of fire. Forget what you've been told in the past.<br>
<br>
(Plasma!) Electrons are free. (Plasma!) A fourth way to be. Not gas, not liquid, not solid.<br>
(Plasma!) Forget that song. (Plasma!) They got it wrong. The thesis has been rendered invalid<br>
