<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Wide awake, late at night, choices to make in the<br>
 morrow...<br>
 Voices in side offer comforting lies...<br>
 whispering reasons to not even try...<br>
The stakes are so high, don’t got much time left to<br>
 borrow...<br>
 ..oh..<br>
<br>
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.<br>
 Can’t walk a way...<br>
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains<br>
 Gotta make something im possible happen to<br>
 day.....<br>
<br>
 Bold attempts aren't enough, roads can't be paved with in<br>
 tentions...<br>
You probably don’t even got what it takes,<br>
But you better try an yway, for everyone's sake<br>
And you won’t find the answer un til you es cape from the<br>
 Labyrinth of your con ventions.<br>
<br>
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.<br>
 Can’t walk a way...<br>
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains<br>
 Gotta make something im possible happen to<br>
 day.....<br>
<br>
 Morning light rising, the sun so sur prisingly<br>
 Dire and cruel<br>
A flicker of hope in your mind is a’ churning.<br>
You don’t got much time now. Your whole world is burning<br>
Got so many lessons in need of un learning<br>
That once seemed so terribly crucial<br>
<br>
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.<br>
 Can’t walk a way...<br>
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains<br>
 Gotta make something im possible happen to<br>
 day.....<br>
<br>
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.<br>
 Can’t walk a way...<br>
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains<br>
 Gotta make something im possible happen to<br>
 day.....<br>
<br>
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.<br>
 Can’t walk a way...<br>
Gotta make yourself stronger, you don’t got much longer,<br>
 Gotta make something im possible happen to<br>
 day.....<br>
 Gotta make something im possible happen to<br>
 day.....<br>
<br>
 Gotta make something im possible happen to<br>
 day.....<br>
