 Wide awake, late at night, choices to make in the
 morrow...   
 Voices in side offer comforting lies...
 whispering reasons to not even try...
The stakes are so high, don’t got much time left to
 borrow...   
 ..oh..   
    
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.
 Can’t walk a way...  
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains
 Gotta make something im possible happen to
 day.....   
    
 Bold attempts aren't enough, roads can't be paved with in
 tentions...   
You probably don’t even got what it takes, 
But you better try an yway, for everyone's sake
And you won’t find the answer un til you es cape from the
 Labyrinth of your con ventions. 
    
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.
 Can’t walk a way...  
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains
 Gotta make something im possible happen to
 day.....   
    
 Morning light rising, the sun so sur prisingly
 Dire and cruel  
A flicker of hope in your mind is a’ churning.
You don’t got much time now. Your whole world is burning
Got so many lessons in need of un learning
That once seemed so terribly crucial 
    
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.
 Can’t walk a way...  
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains
 Gotta make something im possible happen to
 day.....   
    
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.
 Can’t walk a way...  
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains
 Gotta make something im possible happen to
 day.....   
    
Its time to just shut up, and do the im possible.
 Can’t walk a way...  
Gotta make yourself stronger, you don’t got much longer,
 Gotta make something im possible happen to
 day.....   
 Gotta make something im possible happen to
 day.....   
    
 Gotta make something im possible happen to
 day.....
