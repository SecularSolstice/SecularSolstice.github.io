<p>We use the TMBG version, but it's based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Q4VYHPZw8">an older, very similar song by Tom Glazer and Dottie Evans</a>. How much credit the latter should get is debatable. They're kind of the same song, but only kind of.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas<br>
A gigantic nuclear furnace<br>
Where hydrogen is built into helium<br>
At a temperature of millions of degrees<br>
<br>
Yo ho, it's hot, the sun is not<br>
A place where we could live<br>
But here on earth there'd be no life<br>
Without the light it gives<br>
<br>
We need it's light<br>
We need it's heat<br>
We need it's energy<br>
Without the sun, without a doubt<br>
There'd be no you and me<br>
<br>
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas<br>
A gigantic nuclear furnace<br>
Where hydrogen is built into helium<br>
At a temperature of millions of degrees<br>
<br>
The sun is hot<br>
<br>
It is so hot that everything on it is a gas: iron, copper, aluminum, and many others.<br>
<br>
The sun is large<br>
<br>
If the sun were hollow, a million earths could fit inside. and yet, the sun is only a middle-sized star.<br>
<br>
The sun is far away<br>
<br>
About 93 million miles away, and that's why it looks so small.<br>
<br>
And even when it's out of sight<br>
The sun shines night and day<br>
<br>
The sun gives heat<br>
The sun gives light<br>
The sunlight that we see<br>
The sunlight comes from our own sun's<br>
Atomic energy<br>
<br>
(*)Scientists have found that the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine. the heat and light of the sun come from the nuclear reactions of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and helium.<br>
<br>
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas<br>
A gigantic nuclear furnace<br>
Where hydrogen is built into helium<br>
At a temperature of millions of degrees<br>
