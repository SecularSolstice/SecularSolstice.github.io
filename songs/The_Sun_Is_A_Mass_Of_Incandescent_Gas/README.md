# The Sun Is A Mass Of Incandescent Gas
## By They Might Be Giants (Or Glazer & Evans)
## A mostly accurate ode to the sun

An outside song, original music video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JdWlSF195Y) and lyrics [here](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/theymightbegiants/whydoesthesunshinethesunisamassofincandescentgas.html)

We use the TMBG version, but it's based on [an older, very similar song by Tom Glazer and Dottie Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Q4VYHPZw8).  How much credit the latter should get is debatable.  They're kind of the same song, but only kind of.
