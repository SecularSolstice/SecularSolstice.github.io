So bright
Jewel in the night
There in my window below

So bright
Dark as the night
With all of our cities aglow

It's long been our way
To honor this day
And offer goodwill to men

And though
Where ever we go
It's come 'round to Christmas again

So far
Shines every star
There without limit to see

So grand
Faraway land
Beckoning, calling to me

And let it be shown
Wherever we go
In all of the wonders above

With all that we bring
There's no finer thing
Than this message, this promise of love

Love for the families
That gather below
Love for the stranger
That you'll never know
For those who are with you
Who wander above

So bright
Jewel in the night
There lies the cradle we knew

Home of
All that we love
And all of our memories too

It shall be our way to wander away
To take with us all that we know

And never cease
This message of peace
From Bethlehem so long ago

And never cease
This message of peace
From Bethlehem so long ago
