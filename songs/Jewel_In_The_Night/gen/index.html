<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
So bright<br>
Jewel in the night<br>
There in my window below<br>
<br>
So bright<br>
Dark as the night<br>
With all of our cities aglow<br>
<br>
It's long been our way<br>
To honor this day<br>
And offer goodwill to men<br>
<br>
And though<br>
Where ever we go<br>
It's come 'round to Christmas again<br>
<br>
So far<br>
Shines every star<br>
There without limit to see<br>
<br>
So grand<br>
Faraway land<br>
Beckoning, calling to me<br>
<br>
And let it be shown<br>
Wherever we go<br>
In all of the wonders above<br>
<br>
With all that we bring<br>
There's no finer thing<br>
Than this message, this promise of love<br>
<br>
Love for the families<br>
That gather below<br>
Love for the stranger<br>
That you'll never know<br>
For those who are with you<br>
Who wander above<br>
<br>
So bright<br>
Jewel in the night<br>
There lies the cradle we knew<br>
<br>
Home of<br>
All that we love<br>
And all of our memories too<br>
<br>
It shall be our way to wander away<br>
To take with us all that we know<br>
<br>
And never cease<br>
This message of peace<br>
From Bethlehem so long ago<br>
<br>
And never cease<br>
This message of peace<br>
From Bethlehem so long ago<br>
</p>
