# Jewel in the Night
## By Chris Hadfield
## The beuaty of Earth from above, and a re-affirmation of Christmas

This song was written and recorded aboard the international space station.  An [audio recording with photos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=180&v=YufsbE4-jmY) is available.

(Yes, this is the same Chris Hadfield who did the famous [Space Oddity Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo).)
