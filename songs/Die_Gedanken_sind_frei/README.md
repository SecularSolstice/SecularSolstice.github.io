#  Die Gedanken Sind Frei
## By Hoffmann von Fallersleben et. al.
## Thought is free

The current version is from 1842, but variants from 1780 exist and fragments appear to date from the 13th century.  As one might expect, it's been used as a protest song against many repressive governments over the centuries.  Those old enough to remember East Germany may attach special weight to this song.

(Sadly, this pattern now includes neonazis facing government censorship.  What can you do?)

Direct English translation (courtesy of wikipedea):

> Thoughts are free, who can guess them?    
> They fly by like nocturnal shadows.    
> No person can know them, no hunter can shoot them    
> with powder and lead: Thoughts are free!    
>     
> I think what I want, and what delights me,    
> still always reticent, and as it is suitable.    
> My wish and desire, no one can deny me    
> and so it will always be: Thoughts are free!    
>     
> And if I am thrown into the darkest dungeon,    
> all these are futile works,    
> because my thoughts tear all gates    
> and walls apart: Thoughts are free!    
>     
> So I will renounce my sorrows forever,    
> and never again will torture myself with whimsies.    
> In one's heart, one can always laugh and joke    
> and think at the same time: Thoughts are free!    
>     
> I love wine, and my girl even more,    
> Only her I like best of all.    
> I'm not alone with my glass of wine,    
> my girl is with me: Thoughts are free!
