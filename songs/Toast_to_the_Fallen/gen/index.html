<p>I wrote this song to take the To Bring On The Night speech slot
(Beyond the Reach of God, No Royal Road…) for an all-music solstice. Not
yet tested.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  Here's to the folk of Easter Island<br>
  Who's art we admire today<br>
  Their numbers and powers have dwindled<br>
  With the trees they required gone away<br>
<br>
  And here's to the lords of Mississippi<br>
  Mysterious builders of mounds<br>
  They knew not the plagues that assailed them<br>
  We know not the names of their towns<br>
<br>
  Yes and here's to the final Western Romans<br>
  Devoured from without and within<br>
  Our scholars still ask just what failed them<br>
  Or how any cure might begin<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    So we pour out a toast to the fallen<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    And another for those time forgot<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Who strove with the last ounce of courage<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    But strove with enough they did not<br>
<br>
  Here's to the good old League of Nations<br>
  Whose quest was 'Prevent World War'<br>
  They hardly impeded the second<br>
  Now let's see how we face three and four<br>
<br>
  And here's to the ones who saw it coming<br>
  Whose warnings the world did not heed<br>
  And here's to the ones who died working<br>
  But had not the clues that they'd need<br>
<br>
  Yes and here's to the ones who wanted better<br>
  But dared not take eyes off their foes<br>
  And here's to their mansions that burned down<br>
  The fires quite unquenched by their blows<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    So we pour out a toast to the fallen<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    And another for those time forgot<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Who strove with the last ounce of courage<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    But strove with enough they did not<br>
<br>
  Yes we pour out a toast to the fallen<br>
  And a toast for the ones who now fall<br>
  And we wonder if someday somebody<br>
  Will pour out a toast for us all<br>
</p>
