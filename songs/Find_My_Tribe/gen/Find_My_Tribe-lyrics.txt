I'm rugged. Self Reliant.
Like to stand alone.
Figure shit out on my own.
Metacontrarian to the bone.

Metacontrarian to the bone... ...oh....

I must confess I take some satisfaction,
Pointin’, laughin’,
All that tribal nonsense,
Blatant fiction,
All with such absurd conviction.
Yet...

And yet I must admit sometimes...
...I think it might be kinda nice...
...I really wish that I...

Chorus:

Could find a tribe.... that I could call my own...
Find my kind... wanna build a home...
Wanna carve me a cultural cornerstone...
Wanna find my tribe, find my tribe
Find my tribe, find my tribe..

Find my tribe tribe, find my tribe...
...find my tribe.

...

Don’t want my identity
Consumed within the hive
Fraid that ideology'll
Slip its tendrils in my mind

And yet sometimes, it seems
Its not so awful of a dream,
To know I got my people’s back
And know that they got mine

I wanna find a tribe.... that I could call my own...
Find my kind... wanna build a home...
Wanna carve me a cultural cornerstone...
Wanna find my tribe, find my tribe
Find my tribe, find my tribe..

Find my tribe tribe, find my tribe...
...find my tribe.

...

(Instrumental something or other)

...

A burning itch to know,
No matter how the truth might sting
A deep dissatisfaction with a 
Status quo so maddening,

If I found folk who always try,
To question why and understand
Keep on striving, optimizin'
Building somethin' grand.

Chorus:

Gonna find a tribe.... that we can call our own...
Gonna find our kind... we’re gonna build a home...
Gonna carve us a cultural cornerstone...
Gonna find our tribe, find our tribe
Find our tribe, find our tribe...

Find my tribe, find my tribe.
