<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
I’ll live to see, a million things, that men were never meant to see,<br>
My senses and my faculties, augmented with machinery.<br>
Auditory, optical, touch and taste olfactory<br>
Converted into data streams and flooding bits of binary<br>
Every piece of food you taste, and every thought you cogitate<br>
Every sound that you can hear and sights you see for years and years<br>
All stored up so conveniently on peta-bytes of memory<br>
So you can always reference them in case you forget anything<br>
<br>
Singularity, Singularity!<br>
Singularity, Singularity!<br>
Oh..... I don’t know...<br>
(Repeat once)<br>
<br>
Now once all that experience can fit into an easy grid<br>
Existence is no longer something physically limited.<br>
The wires that you have inside are very easily realized<br>
Through artificial imaging you duplicate 10 at a time.<br>
Your consciousness can be enjoyed by anyone forever more.<br>
And you live in whatever state that you or anyone creates.<br>
You could be a giant squirrel, a statue or a burning thorn,<br>
a talking cat, an etch-a-sketch, a squid or a robot unicorn.<br>
You’d keep all the memories and feelings you could ever want,<br>
And now you can commence your life as an uploaded extropian<br>
<br>
Singularity, Singularity...<br>
<br>
My mother is so horrified by this post-human fantasy<br>
she says we’d lose that special thing that gives us our humanity.<br>
But I don’t know. I’m not so sure if humans are so good and pure.<br>
Perhaps we’d be much better off if we took these violent bodies off.<br>
<br>
Once everyone is in the cloud we’ll move beyond this earthly ground,<br>
expanding into outer space as an informational signal race.<br>
Matter in the solar system converts into computing mass<br>
and the sun becomes a central orb of a brain that grows into the vast<br>
expanse of space and emptiness for light years and light centuries.<br>
It replicates exponentially like a Russian doll in a cosmic dream.<br>
Once every spot of the universe is filled up it will promptly burst<br>
eradicating finally the experiment that we grew from earth<br>
As it explodes the brain will breathe into the dark impossibly,<br>
and anti-matter all around will collapse the universe back down,<br>
and right away what you would see if you were a fly in the vacancy<br>
is all the light and color in the universe is collapsing.<br>
<br>
And Time Would Stop.<br>
<br>
….<br>
<br>
And from a tiny pinhole point...<br>
 a vast bang erupts...<br>
into space....<br>
<br>
And trillions of new particles...<br>
 fly away at a photonic...<br>
pace...<br>
<br>
And......<br>
Once again the clock would start to tick and tock and tick and tock<br>
and years would pass, billions or more before the tiny proteins locked<br>
and yet again in the boiling seas of a miniscule blue anomaly.<br>
A planet floating helplessly around a tiny ball so fiery.<br>
An unextraordinary corner of the universe would cradle it:<br>
The flicker of intelligence that led us here and brought us this…<br>
<br>
Singularity, Singularity!<br>
Singularity, Singularity!<br>
Oh..... I don’t know...<br>
<br>
Singularity, Singularity!<br>
Singularity, Singularity!<br>
Oh..... I don’t know...<br>
<br>
Oh... I don’t know...<br>
