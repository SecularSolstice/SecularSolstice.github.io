<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
There’s one piece of wisdom that sticks in my head -<br>
I heard it someplace, or it’s something I read<br>
About someone or other whose grandmother said<br>
That life is too short to fold underwear.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to fold underwear,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to play solitaire;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Get off your duff, it’s time to begin -<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  There’s good deeds to do and there’s sins to be sinned<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And there’s not enough time to fit it all in –<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to fold underwear.<br>
<br>
Life is too short to eat processed cheese<br>
Or mealy tomatoes or third-rate Chinese,<br>
Or to live someplace dismal without any trees,<br>
And life is too short to fold underwear.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to fold underwear,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to play solitaire;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Get off your duff, it’s time to begin -<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  There’s good deeds to do and there’s sins to be sinned<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And there’s not enough time to fit it all in –<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to fold underwear.<br>
<br>
Life is too short to spend it alone<br>
Or with folks that are mean, or a long way from home,<br>
Or to serve an obsession that isn’t your own,<br>
And life is too short to fold underwear.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to fold underwear,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to play solitaire;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Get off your duff, it’s time to begin -<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  There’s good deeds to do and there’s sins to be sinned<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And there’s not enough time to fit it all in –<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Life is too short to fold underwear.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Yes, life is too short to fold underwear.<br>
