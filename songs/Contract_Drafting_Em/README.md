# The Contract Drafting Em
## By Zack Davis
## The special horror when your employer has root on your brain

This is one of the few songs that will truly *lose* outsiders.  Anyone
who doesn't know what an Em is, or have an intuitive sense of what
being one could feel like will simply *not know* what's going on.
This is both a good and a bad thing.  Barring outsiders creates a
stronger sense of community, and that this is *our* space.  On the
other hand, some of those people are people we'd rather have around.
Proceed with caution.

The music provided here (and included as a live recording in the files
section) is from 2019.  This *was* sung prior to that,
but the melody used is lost.  Raymond has described the older melody
as "sort of vaguely almost-but-not-quite to the tune of Pirates of
Penzance: I Am The Very Model Of A.... It's kind of remarkable how
quickly such things can be lost.


The intention in this melody is for the Managerial Em to sing an
octave below the Contract-Drafting Em.  This symbolizes the manager's
greater "size" in their society, and is noted using the treble_8
clef.  Of course, you can perform it as available singers permit.
