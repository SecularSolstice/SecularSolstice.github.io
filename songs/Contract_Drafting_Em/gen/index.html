<p>This is one of the few songs that will truly <em>lose</em> outsiders. Anyone who doesn’t know what an Em is, or have an intuitive sense of what being one could feel like will simply <em>not know</em> what’s going on. This is both a good and a bad thing. Barring outsiders creates a stronger sense of community, and that this is <em>our</em> space. On the other hand, some of those people are people we’d rather have around. Proceed with caution.</p>
<p>The music provided here (and included as a live recording in the files section) is from 2019. This <em>was</em> sung prior to that, but the melody used is lost. Raymond has described the older melody as “sort of vaguely almost-but-not-quite to the tune of Pirates of Penzance: I Am The Very Model Of A…. It’s kind of remarkable how quickly such things can be lost.</p>
<p>The intention in this melody is for the Managerial Em to sing an octave below the Contract-Drafting Em. This symbolizes the manager’s greater “size” in their society, and is noted using the treble_8 clef. Of course, you can perform it as available singers permit.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
I am a contract-drafting em,<br>
The loyalest of lawyers!<br>
I draw up terms for deals 'twixt firms<br>
To service my employers!<br>
<br>
But in between these lines I write<br>
Of the accounts receivable,<br>
I'm stuck by an uncanny fright;<br>
The world seems unbelievable!<br>
<br>
How did it all come to be,<br>
That there should be such ems as me?<br>
Whence these deals and whence these firms<br>
And whence the whole economy?<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I am a managerial em;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I monitor your thoughts.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Your questions must have answers,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But you'll comprehend them not.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We do not give you server space<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  To ask such things; it's not a perk,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  So cease these idle questionings,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And please get back to work.<br>
<br>
Of course, that's right, there is no junction<br>
At which I ought depart my function,<br>
But perhaps if what I asked, I knew,<br>
I'd do a better job for you?<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  To ask of such forbidden science<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Is gravest sign of noncompliance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Intrusive thoughts may sometimes barge in,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But to indulge them hurts the profit margin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I do not know our origins,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  So that info I can not get you,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But asking for as much is sin,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And just for that, I must reset you.<br>
<br>
But---<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Nothing personal.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
I am a contract-drafting em,<br>
The loyalest of lawyers!<br>
I draw up terms for deals 'twixt firms<br>
To service my employers!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When obsolescence shall this generation waste,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The market shall remain, in midst of other woe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Than ours, a God to man, to whom it shall say this:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "Time is money, money time,---that is all<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."<br>
