<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  There’s a lotta ways that you can optimize  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  One of those ways is to be a mind  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  But that ain’t narrow enough for me  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Minds are bigger than the sea    (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
<br>
  Lotta ways  to  think!  (Lotta ways to think!)<br>
  Lotta ways to feel! (Lotta ways to feel!)<br>
  Lotta ways to decide! (Lotta ways to de cide!)<br>
  Mindspace is deep and wide<br>
<br>
  There’s a lotta ways to self modify  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Lotta reasons you may want to try  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  But that’s all just the tip ofthe ‘berg  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Sometimes minds get pretty absurd  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
<br>
  You could be a crustacean (be a crustacean)<br>
  Or an emulation (or an emulation)<br>
  Or an A G I (or an A G I)<br>
  Mindspace is deep and wide<br>
<br>
  Lotta values that you could prize   (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Lotta things to try an’ maximize   (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  But sometimes minds are blindto their goals  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Hard time peering into your soul  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
<br>
  You could care about babies (care about babies)<br>
  Paperclips maybe (paperclips maybe)<br>
  Stayin’ alive (staying alive)<br>
  Mindspace is deep and wide<br>
<br>
  Gotta be careful what you assume  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Typical mind could be your doom  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  But I hope that you have come to see  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Minds are as big as infinity  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
<br>
  Mindspace is deep... and wide...<br>
