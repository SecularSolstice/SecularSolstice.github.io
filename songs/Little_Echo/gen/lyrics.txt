[V1] My heart is beating. 
My breath is strong. 
I’m walkin’, runnin’, dancin’, playin’. 
Havin’ fun. 

The wheels inside my mind are turnin’, 
Thinkin’, feelin’, loving’, learning. 
Wonderin’ what kind of person 
I’ll become. 

[Both] And life ticks on, 
And lives connect 
And over time I 
Collect a little echo 
of your mind, and so, even 
when we're separated 
Even though it's not the same 
It's sort of nice to say your name 
And hear you whisper mine. 

[V2] My heart is skippin’. 
I take a nervous breath. 
I finally see your face again. 
It’s been so long since last you left. 

I got a little metal circle 
Hanging on my chest. 
As we collide, and intertwine, 
It presses cold against my breast. 

[Both] And life ticks on, 
And lives connect 
And over time I 
Collect a little echo 
of your mind, 
and so, even when we're separated 
Even though it's not the same 
It's sort of nice to say your name 
And hear you whisper mine. 

[V1] My heart is failin’ 
My breath is slow. 
I’m lookin’, longin’, lovin’, wishin’ 
That I didn’t have to go. 

I've got a little metal circle
Lying on my chest
It's got some little words inscribed
To guide me to my rest

And dare I hope, in flesh or spirit,
Somewhere, someday I'll awake?
Though I can't guess how things might change
I just don't know what world you would make
While I was gone
I just don’t know. 
I just don’t know how long. 

[V2] And life ticks on, 
And lives connect 
And over time I 
Collect a little echo 
of your mind, 
and so, even when we're separated 
Even though it's not the same 
It's sort of nice to say your name 
And hear you whisper mine.
