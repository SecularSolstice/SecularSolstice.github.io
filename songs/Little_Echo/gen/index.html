<h2 id="love-life-death-and-the-desperate-hope-for-life-again">Love,
life, death, and the desperate hope for life again</h2>
<p>Having two voices for this is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Emphasize to the pianist that we really do want that steady, high-c
heartbeat. If a drummer is available, have a bass drum at half the
rhythm (the left side of the heart).</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/a-little-echo">original</a>
was more explicitly about cryonics. This version is designed to be
ambiguous as to what the metal circle is.</p>
<p>The sheet music has not been properly proofread and may contain small
errors. When we performed this at NYC2017, there was more memory and
improvisation than reading of the score, so that wasn’t really a
test.</p>
<p>This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the <a
href="https://humanistculturebandcampcom/album/brighter-than-today-a-secular-solstice">2013</a>
album.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
[V1] My heart is beating.<br>
My breath is strong.<br>
I’m walkin’, runnin’, dancin’, playin’.<br>
Havin’ fun.<br>
<br>
The wheels inside my mind are turnin’,<br>
Thinkin’, feelin’, loving’, learning.<br>
Wonderin’ what kind of person<br>
I’ll become.<br>
<br>
[Both] And life ticks on,<br>
And lives connect<br>
And over time I<br>
Collect a little echo<br>
of your mind, and so, even<br>
when we're separated<br>
Even though it's not the same<br>
It's sort of nice to say your name<br>
And hear you whisper mine.<br>
<br>
[V2] My heart is skippin’.<br>
I take a nervous breath.<br>
I finally see your face again.<br>
It’s been so long since last you left.<br>
<br>
I got a little metal circle<br>
Hanging on my chest.<br>
As we collide, and intertwine,<br>
It presses cold against my breast.<br>
<br>
[Both] And life ticks on,<br>
And lives connect<br>
And over time I<br>
Collect a little echo<br>
of your mind,<br>
and so, even when we're separated<br>
Even though it's not the same<br>
It's sort of nice to say your name<br>
And hear you whisper mine.<br>
<br>
[V1] My heart is failin’<br>
My breath is slow.<br>
I’m lookin’, longin’, lovin’, wishin’<br>
That I didn’t have to go.<br>
<br>
I've got a little metal circle<br>
Lying on my chest<br>
It's got some little words inscribed<br>
To guide me to my rest<br>
<br>
And dare I hope, in flesh or spirit,<br>
Somewhere, someday I'll awake?<br>
Though I can't guess how things might change<br>
I just don't know what world you would make<br>
While I was gone<br>
I just don’t know.<br>
I just don’t know how long.<br>
<br>
[V2] And life ticks on,<br>
And lives connect<br>
And over time I<br>
Collect a little echo<br>
of your mind,<br>
and so, even when we're separated<br>
Even though it's not the same<br>
It's sort of nice to say your name<br>
And hear you whisper mine.<br>
