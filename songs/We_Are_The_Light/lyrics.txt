Onward, onward through the darkness 
Night proclaims a promise we must keep 
As the shadows close around us 
Arise, for we are the light

Cold, we tremble, young and frightened 
Ours to conquer, yet ours to grieve 
Soon the dawn shall break around us 
in morning, we die no more 
in morning, we die no more
