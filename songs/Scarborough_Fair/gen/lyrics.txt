        Are you going to Scarborough Fair
        Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
        Remember me to one who lives there
        She Once was a true love of mine

        Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
        Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
        Without no seams nor nee-ee-dle work
        Then she'll be a true love of mine

        Tell her to find me an acre of land
        Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
        Between the salt water and the sea strands
        Then she'll be a true love of mine

        Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
        Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
        And gather it all in a bunch of heather
        Then she'll be a true love of mine

        Are you going to Scarborough Fair
        Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
        Remember me to one who lives there
        She Once was a true love of mine
