 Are you going to Scarborough Fair
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
 Remember me to one who lives there
 She Once was a true love of mine

 Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
 Without no seams nor nee-ee-dle work
 Then she'll be a true love of mine

 Tell her to find me an acre of land
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
 Between the salt water and the sea strands
 Then she'll be a true love of mine

 Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
 And gather it all in a bunch of heather
 Then she'll be a true love of mine

 Are you going to Scarborough Fair
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
 Remember me to one who lives there
 She Once was a true love of mine
