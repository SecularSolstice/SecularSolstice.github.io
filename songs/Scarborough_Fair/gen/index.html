<h2 id="traditional">Traditional</h2>
<h2 id="a-series-of-impossible-challenges">A series of impossible challenges</h2>
<p>This is an English folk ballad, so of course many versions exist.</p>
<p>The general form is a set of impossible challenges by which the singer's love may be earned. There exists a similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elfin_Knight">Scottish ballad</a> which is fae-based, suggesting a fae connection here as well, but it isn't in the text. Folklorically speaking, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">Impossible Tasks</a> are common both with fae involvement and between mortal lovers. Unlike many versions of this trope, there are no canonical solutions to the challenges presented here.</p>
<p>This song was made famous when Simon and Garfunkel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BakWVXHSug">intercut it with war-related lyrics</a>. That element was there addition. The rest of the song is older.</p>
<p>This song doesn't have a lot of direct rationalist or solstice significance, but it sets up its <a href="../../Scarborough_Fair_Dark_Reprise/gen/">dark</a> and <a href="../../Scarborough_Fair_Triumphant_Reprise/gen/">triumphant</a> reprises. It might also set up <a href="../../Something_Impossible/gen/">Something Impossible</a>.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Are you going to Scarborough Fair<br>
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme<br>
 Remember me to one who lives there<br>
 She Once was a true love of mine<br>
<br>
 Tell her to make me a cambric shirt<br>
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme<br>
 Without no seams nor nee-ee-dle work<br>
 Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>
<br>
 Tell her to find me an acre of land<br>
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme<br>
 Between the salt water and the sea strands<br>
 Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>
<br>
 Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather<br>
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme<br>
 And gather it all in a bunch of heather<br>
 Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>
<br>
 Are you going to Scarborough Fair<br>
 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme<br>
 Remember me to one who lives there<br>
 She Once was a true love of mine<br>
</p>
