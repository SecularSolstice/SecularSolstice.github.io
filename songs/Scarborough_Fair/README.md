#  Scarborough Fair
## Traditional
## A series of impossible challenges

This is an English folk ballad, so of course many versions exist.

The general form is a set of impossible challenges by which the
singer's love may be earned.  There exists a similar [Scottish
ballad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elfin_Knight) which is
fae-based, suggesting a fae connection here as well, but it isn't in
the text.  Folklorically speaking, [Impossible
Tasks](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask) are
common both with fae involvement and between mortal lovers.  Unlike
many versions of this trope, there are no canonical solutions to the
challenges presented here.

This song was made famous when Simon and Garfunkel [intercut it with
war-related lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BakWVXHSug).
That element was there addition.  The rest of the song is older.

This song doesn't have a lot of direct rationalist or solstice
significance, but it sets up its
[dark](../../Scarborough_Fair_Dark_Reprise/gen/) and
[triumphant](../../Scarborough_Fair_Triumphant_Reprise/gen/)
reprises.  It might also set up [Something Impossible](../../Something_Impossible/gen/).
