<p>The original was just about a giant, fire-breathing, flying lizard, but recontextualized in solstice it might remind people of the Fable of the Dragon Tyrant. Or not.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Come along and celebrate<br>
Our suffering has ended<br>
Come along and celebrate<br>
The world the smith has mended<br>
Here lies the dragon cold and dead<br>
To trouble us no more<br>
Here lies the dragon cold and dead<br>
To rest forevermore<br>
<br>
Come along and celebrate<br>
Our suffering has ended<br>
Come along and celebrate<br>
The world the smith has mended<br>
Here lies the dragon cold and dead<br>
To trouble us no more<br>
Here lies the dragon cold and dead<br>
To rest forevermore<br>
<br>
So many have met their death<br>
Who fell to the fiery monster’s breath<br>
But heartless worm there lies at last<br>
And now our pain is past<br>
<br>
So many have met their death<br>
Who fell to the fiery monster’s breath<br>
But heartless worm there lies at last<br>
And now our pain is past<br>
<br>
Hear ye! Hear all high and low<br>
Our joy has reawoken<br>
Hear ye! Hear all high and low<br>
The dragon’s curse is broken<br>
Pour some wine and raise your glass<br>
This calls for celebration<br>
Pour some beer and raise your glass<br>
Forever jubilation<br>
<br>
Hear ye! Hear all high and low<br>
Our joy has reawoken<br>
Hear ye! Hear all high and low<br>
The dragon’s curse is broken<br>
Pour some wine and raise your glass<br>
This calls for celebration<br>
Pour some beer and raise your glass<br>
Forever jubilation<br>
<br>
So many have met their death<br>
Who fell to the fiery monster’s breath<br>
But heartless worm there lies at last<br>
And now our pain is past<br>
<br>
So many have met their death<br>
Who fell to the fiery monster’s breath<br>
But heartless worm there lies at last<br>
And now our pain is past<br>
<br>
Give a hearty cheerful swell<br>
And welcome endless pleasure<br>
As it should be, all is well<br>
So clap your hands together<br>
There’s nothing now to make us sad<br>
The sun is ever glowing<br>
We sing aloud so bold and glad<br>
With mirth aplenty flowing<br>
<br>
Day and night come dance with us<br>
And savor life with singing<br>
Every flask runs dry at once<br>
What gift’s tomorrow bringing?<br>
Old sorrow let us leave behind<br>
No more be heavy-hearted<br>
I bring for us the best of wines<br>
The feast has hardly started<br>
<br>
Come along and celebrate<br>
Our suffering has ended<br>
Come along and celebrate<br>
The world the smith has mended<br>
Here lies the dragon cold and dead<br>
To trouble us no more<br>
Here lies the dragon cold and dead<br>
To rest forevermore<br>
