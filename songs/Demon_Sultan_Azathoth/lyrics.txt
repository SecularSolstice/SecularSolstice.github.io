Demon Sultan Azathoth
Bubbles in confusion.
Center of the Universe,
Sprouting foul protrusions.
Muffled madd'ning beating drums,
Hellish flutes a-playing
Round him dance the Other Gods
Voiceless, mindless swaying.

Many-formed Nyarlathotep
Bodes mankind's destruction.
Calls us to our certain doom,
Voice full of seduction.
You can't help but dance behind
Gyrating and turning.
Tears of joy streak down your face
As the world dies burning.

Yog-Sothoth is Gate and Key,
Binding time to matter
When his gaze falls on the earth
Laws of physics shatter
Try to chain him with your laws--
Pitiful equations!
Naught but dust and sand shall mark
Your obliteration!
