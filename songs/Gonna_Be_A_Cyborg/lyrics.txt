A lion
Is tearin 
up my tribe, I don’t know what to do
I’m cryin’, 
despairin
So many died my legs all chewed
but I
Just tie
A hide around my bloody knee
Then lash a peg
Tight to my leg
And take a stand upon some brand new feet
Walkin’ tall now

Gonna be a cyborg, more than just a human being
Gonna be a cyborg, blending flesh into machine
Gonna be a cyborg, sorry if I freak you out but I
Got some things that won’t get done
If I’m only hu...man

Do do do… Gonna be a cyborg
Do do do… yeah, yeah

My eyes, 
can’t see
So well as they once used to
I tried 
to read
The signs ‘round town its useless
Frustration
Motivation
I wanna see some stars at night
Can’t just lament,
Experiment
Til I invent a way to bend some light
Right into my eyeballs

Gonna be a cyborg, more than just a human being
Gonna be a cyborg, blending flesh into machine
Gonna be a cyborg, sorry if I freak you out but I
Got some things that won’t get done
If I’m only hu...man

Do do do… Gonna be a cyborg
Do do do… yeah, yeah

I got
Some thoughts
‘bout space and time to share
But my body
Is slowly
Lockin down, I’m getting pretty scared
Can’t hardly walk
Now hardly talk,
Now struggle, just to blink my eye
But press this keyboard to my cheek
Computer’s helping me to speak
I got myself a couple lectures to write
(And a brief history of time)

Gonna be a cyborg, more than just a human being
Gonna be a cyborg, blending flesh into machine
Gonna be a cyborg, sorry if I freak you out but I
Got some things that won’t get done
If I’m only hu...man

Do do do… Gonna be a cyborg
Do do do… blending flesh into machine
Do do do… Gonna be a cyborg
Do do do… More than just a human being

A global hivemind in my pocket
Bluetooth headset in my ear
MRIs connecting minds
Directly to the twittersphere
Future’s comin’ ain’t no doubt
Some folk already freaking out
But we got some things that won’t get done
If we’re only human
