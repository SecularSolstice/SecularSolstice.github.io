<h2 id="the-beuaty-of-the-night-sky">The beuaty of the night sky</h2>
<p>First published as a poem in 1930, then adapted to music in 2011. The adaptation calls for six singers (three tenor, three baritone) and six wineglasses, tuned by partially filling them with water. The wineglasses give the song a lovely ethereal quality, but finding skilled wineglass players may be difficult.</p>
<p>The composer’s website discusses the song <a href="https://www.eriksesenvalds.com/works/stars">here</a>, including an audio recording and links from which to buy sheet music.</p>
<p>No relation to the song from <em>Les Miserables</em>, which is very differnt.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Alone in the night<br>
On a dark hill<br>
With pines around me<br>
Spicy and still,<br>
<br>
And a heaven full of stars<br>
Over my head<br>
White and topaz<br>
And misty red;<br>
<br>
Myriads with beating<br>
Hearts of fire<br>
The aeons<br>
Cannot vex or tire;<br>
<br>
Up the dome of heaven<br>
Like a great hill<br>
I watch them marching<br>
Stately and still.<br>
<br>
And I know that I<br>
Am honored to be<br>
Witness<br>
Of so much majesty.<br>
</p>
