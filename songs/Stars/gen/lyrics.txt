Alone in the night
On a dark hill
With pines around me
Spicy and still, 

And a heaven full of stars
Over my head
White and topaz
And misty red; 

Myriads with beating
Hearts of fire
The aeons
Cannot vex or tire; 

Up the dome of heaven
Like a great hill
I watch them marching
Stately and still. 

And I know that I
Am honored to be
Witness
Of so much majesty.
