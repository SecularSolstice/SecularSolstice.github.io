#  Stars
## By Sara Teasdale (lyrics) and Eriks Esenvalds (Music)
## The beuaty of the night sky

First published as a poem in 1930, then adapted to music in 2011.  The
adaptation calls for six singers (three tenor, three baritone) and six
wineglasses, tuned by partially filling them with water.  The
wineglasses give the song a lovely ethereal quality, but finding
skilled wineglass players may be difficult.

The composer's website discusses the song
[here](https://www.eriksesenvalds.com/works/stars), including an audio
recording and links from which to buy sheet music.

No relation to the song from *Les Miserables*, which is very differnt.
