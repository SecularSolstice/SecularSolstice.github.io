# The Mary Ellen Spider
## Tune by Stan Rogers, Lyrics by Bob Blue
## A metaphor of persistance

This is a parody of Mary Ellen Carter, a bit sillier and with even less subtext. Various versions of this exist, with the earliest I'm aware of being Tom Smith's version [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn4xmAwkcFs). Sometimes this is called Eensie Weensie Spider, but there's a different song sometimes using that title.
