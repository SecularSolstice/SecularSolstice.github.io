<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
There's no place in this world where I'll belong when I'm gone<br>
And I won't know the right from the wrong when I'm gone<br>
And you won't find me singin' on this song when I'm gone<br>
So I guess I'll have to do it while I'm here<br>
<br>
And I won't feel the flowing of the time when I'm gone<br>
All the pleasures of love will not be mine when I'm gone<br>
My pen won't pour a lyric line when I'm gone<br>
So I guess I'll have to do it while I'm here<br>
<br>
And I won't breathe the bracing air when I'm gone<br>
And I can't even worry 'bout my cares when I'm gone<br>
Won't be asked to do my share when I'm gone<br>
So I guess I'll have to do it while I'm here<br>
<br>
And I won't be running from the rain when I'm gone<br>
And I can't even suffer from the pain when I'm gone<br>
Can't say who's to praise and who's to blame when I'm gone<br>
So I guess I'll have to do it while I'm here<br>
<br>
Won't see the golden of the sun when I'm gone<br>
And the evenings and the mornings will be one when I'm gone<br>
Can't be singing louder than the guns while I'm gone<br>
So I guess I'll have to do it while I'm here<br>
<br>
All my days won't be dances of delight when I'm gone<br>
And the sands will be shifting from my sight when I'm gone<br>
Can't add my name into the fight while I'm gone<br>
So I guess I'll have to do it while I'm here<br>
<br>
And I won't be laughing at the lies when I'm gone<br>
And I can't question how, or when, or why when I'm gone<br>
Can't live proud enough to die when I'm gone<br>
So I guess I'll have to do it while I'm here<br>
<br>
There's no place in this world where I'll belong when I'm gone<br>
And I won't know the right from the wrong when I'm gone<br>
And you won't find me singin' on this song when I'm gone<br>
So I guess I'll have to do it<br>
I guess I'll have to do it<br>
Guess I'll have to do it while I'm here!<br>
