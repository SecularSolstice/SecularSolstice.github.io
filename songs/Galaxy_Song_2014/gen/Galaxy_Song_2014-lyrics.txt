Just remember you’re a tiny little person on a planet in a universe expanding and immense
That life began evolving and dissolving and resolving
In the deep primordial oceans by the hydrothermal vents

Our earth which had its birth almost 5 billion years ago from out of a collapsing cloud of gas
grew life which was quite new and eventually led to you in only 3.5 billion years or less

Deoxy-ribonucleic acid helps us replicate 
and randomly mutate from day to day
we left the seas and climbed the trees
and watched as our biologies continued to evolve through DNA

We’re 98.9% the same as chimpanzees
whose trees we left 3 million years ago 
to wander swapping genes out of Africa which means we’re related to everyone we know

Standing on a planet which is spinning round a star one of just 1 billion trillion sons 
In a universe that’s 90 billion light years side to side wondering where the heck it all came from

You’ve a tiny little blink of life to try and understand what on earth is really going on
In biology and chemistry which made you you and made me me but don’t ask me I only sang this song
