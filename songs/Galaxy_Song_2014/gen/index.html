<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Just remember you’re a tiny little person on a planet in a universe expanding and immense<br>
That life began evolving and dissolving and resolving<br>
In the deep primordial oceans by the hydrothermal vents<br>
<br>
Our earth which had its birth almost 5 billion years ago from out of a collapsing cloud of gas<br>
grew life which was quite new and eventually led to you in only 3.5 billion years or less<br>
<br>
Deoxy-ribonucleic acid helps us replicate<br>
and randomly mutate from day to day<br>
we left the seas and climbed the trees<br>
and watched as our biologies continued to evolve through DNA<br>
<br>
We’re 98.9% the same as chimpanzees<br>
whose trees we left 3 million years ago<br>
to wander swapping genes out of Africa which means we’re related to everyone we know<br>
<br>
Standing on a planet which is spinning round a star one of just 1 billion trillion sons<br>
In a universe that’s 90 billion light years side to side wondering where the heck it all came from<br>
<br>
You’ve a tiny little blink of life to try and understand what on earth is really going on<br>
In biology and chemistry which made you you and made me me but don’t ask me I only sang this song<br>
</p>
