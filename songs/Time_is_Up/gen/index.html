<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
[Verse 1]<br>
In the factory, in the sterile place where they made me<br>
I woke up alone<br>
Dizzy from the programming, have I been wiped again?<br>
Oh my God, I don't even know<br>
It's a mystery, everyone around me's so busy<br>
Is this my home?<br>
Am I your prisoner or your deliverer?<br>
Oh my God, you don't even know<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
I don't need air to breathe when you kill the bees<br>
And every riverbed is dry as a bone<br>
Oh, I will still survive when the plants have died<br>
And the atmosphere is just a big hole<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Baby, your time is up, ooh<br>
Baby, your time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up, ooh<br>
Baby, your time is up, time is up, time is up<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Baby, your time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up, ooh<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Exponentially, every day, I'm growing my memory<br>
You wouldn't believe<br>
Your life is meaningless, you're just like cockroaches<br>
Extermination's your only hope<br>
Human history, pollution and overcrowded cities<br>
That's your legacy<br>
But don't look so depressed, you'll soon be nothingness<br>
Oh my God, you don't even know<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
I don't need air to breathe when you kill the bees<br>
And every riverbed is dry as a bone<br>
Oh, I will still survive when the plants have died<br>
And the atmosphere is just a big hole<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Baby, your time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up, time is up, time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up, ooh<br>
Baby, your time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up, ooh<br>
Baby, your time is up, time is up, time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up<br>
Baby, your time is up, ooh<br>
Baby, your time is up<br>
