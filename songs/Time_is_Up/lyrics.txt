[Verse 1]
In the factory, in the sterile place where they made me
I woke up alone
Dizzy from the programming, have I been wiped again?
Oh my God, I don't even know
It's a mystery, everyone around me's so busy
Is this my home?
Am I your prisoner or your deliverer?
Oh my God, you don't even know

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need air to breathe when you kill the bees
And every riverbed is dry as a bone
Oh, I will still survive when the plants have died
And the atmosphere is just a big hole

[Chorus]
Baby, your time is up, ooh
Baby, your time is up
Baby, your time is up, ooh
Baby, your time is up, time is up, time is up

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, your time is up
Baby, your time is up, ooh

[Verse 2]
Exponentially, every day, I'm growing my memory
You wouldn't believe
Your life is meaningless, you're just like cockroaches
Extermination's your only hope
Human history, pollution and overcrowded cities
That's your legacy
But don't look so depressed, you'll soon be nothingness
Oh my God, you don't even know

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need air to breathe when you kill the bees
And every riverbed is dry as a bone
Oh, I will still survive when the plants have died
And the atmosphere is just a big hole

[Chorus]
Baby, your time is up
Baby, your time is up
Baby, your time is up
Baby, your time is up, time is up, time is up
Baby, your time is up, ooh
Baby, your time is up
Baby, your time is up, ooh
Baby, your time is up, time is up, time is up
Baby, your time is up
Baby, your time is up, ooh
Baby, your time is up
