<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown,<br>
And things seem hard or tough,<br>
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,<br>
And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,<br>
<br>
Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving<br>
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.<br>
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,<br>
The sun that is the source of all our power.<br>
<br>
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,<br>
Are moving at a million miles a day,<br>
In the outer spiral arm, at 40, 000 miles an hour,<br>
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.<br>
<br>
Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;<br>
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;<br>
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,<br>
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.<br>
<br>
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,<br>
We go 'round every two hundred million years;<br>
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions<br>
In this amazing and expanding universe.<br>
<br>
Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,<br>
In all of the directions it can whiz;<br>
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,<br>
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.<br>
<br>
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,<br>
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;<br>
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,<br>
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!<br>
</p>
