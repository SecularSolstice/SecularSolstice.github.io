Move the World

Archimedes said if I wanna move a load, gotta 
get myself a lever, lay it on a fulcrum. 
Little bit of effort over quite a bit o’ distance.
I can move a load as big as I wish. I can:
            
	Move the World, if my lever is long enough 
	Move the World, and I’ve a place to stand, I can 
	Move the World, I can make myself strong enough to 
	Move the World, if I got a good plan
        
But I gotta’dmit that the world’s pretty big
And all I got here in my hand is a pitiful twig.
But if I met a friend with a great big beam,
I could say “Hey Friend!” if you share my dream, you can:
            
	Move the World, if your lever is long enough 
	Move the World, and you’ve a place to stand, you can 
	Move the World, you can make myself strong enough to 
	Move the World, if you have a good plan
            
But it seems the beam is still not long enough. 
Simple tools a pretty cool but this is kinda tough (But maybe) 
If we work together we can build a bigger lever,
We can make the world better if we give it a shove. We can:
            
	Move the World, if our lever is long enough 
	Move the World, and we’ve a place to stand, we can 
	Move the World, we can make myself strong enough to 
	Move the World, if we have a good plan, we can
	    
	Move the World, if our lever is long enough 
	Move the World, and we’ve a place to stand, we can 
	Move the World, we can make myself strong enough to 
	Move the World, if we have a good plan, we can
