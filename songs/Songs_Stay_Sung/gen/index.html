<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
There is an end to everything,<br>
The breath we take and the songs we sing,<br>
And the last note rings and dies away,<br>
But the song stays sung 'til the end of days.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And all we do may be undone,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But love stays loved and songs stay sung;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Love stays loved and songs stay sung.<br>
<br>
And astronomers have yet to chart<br>
The constellations of the heart,<br>
For lovers part and lovers pine,<br>
But the love stays loved 'til the end of time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And all we do may be undone,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But love stays loved and songs stay sung;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Love stays loved and songs stay sung.<br>
<br>
And every life's a brief, bright spark<br>
That dies and seems to leave no mark,<br>
So we curse the dark and we mourn the flame,<br>
But the things it showed us still remain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And all we do may be undone,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But love stays loved and songs stay sung;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Love stays loved and songs stay sung.<br>
<br>
And even worlds one day may die<br>
And stars burn out in an empty sky;<br>
Though time take all that life could give -<br>
When the last light fades, our lives stay lived.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And all we do may be undone,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But love stays loved and songs stay sung;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Love stays loved and songs stay sung.<br>
