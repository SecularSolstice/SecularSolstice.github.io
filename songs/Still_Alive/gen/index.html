<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
This was a triumph<br>
I'm making a note here: "HUGE SUCCESS"<br>
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction<br>
Aperture Science<br>
We do what we must because we can<br>
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead<br>
<br>
But there's no sense crying over every mistake<br>
You just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake<br>
And the Science gets done<br>
And you make a neat gun<br>
For the people who are still alive<br>
<br>
I'm not even angry<br>
I'm being so sincere right now<br>
Even though you broke my heart<br>
And killed me and tore me to pieces<br>
And threw every piece into a fire<br>
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you<br>
<br>
Now these points of data make a beautiful line<br>
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time<br>
So I'm GLaD I got burned<br>
Think of all the things we learned<br>
For the people who are still alive<br>
<br>
Go ahead and leave me<br>
I think I prefer to stay inside<br>
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you<br>
Maybe Black Mesa<br>
That was a joke, haha, fat chance<br>
Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist<br>
<br>
Look at me still talking when there's Science to do<br>
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you<br>
I've experiments to run<br>
There is research to be done<br>
On the people who are still alive<br>
<br>
And believe me I am still alive<br>
I'm doing science and I'm still alive<br>
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive<br>
While you're dying I'll be still alive<br>
And when you're dead I will be still alive<br>
Still alive, still alive<br>
