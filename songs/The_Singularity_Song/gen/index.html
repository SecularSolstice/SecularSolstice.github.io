<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
There's a concept in computing,<br>
About a growth that's unrestrained<br>
The exponential rate of computer processing means<br>
all of them computers have brains<br>
<br>
Super intelligent nano-machines,<br>
Self aware by 2045,<br>
Either civilization is in total peace or<br>
none of us'll be alive<br>
<br>
Well I hope the robots are nice,<br>
A benevolent technology<br>
If I have to report to a robot boss<br>
Well I wanna few things for me...<br>
<br>
...I wanna have Robot beer<br>
That autopours in my mouth<br>
I wanna have A robot football coach<br>
To figure my fantasy drafts out<br>
I wanna have A robot lawn<br>
To ride my robot mower on<br>
The dawn of the singularity is the age for which I Iong<br>
<br>
If we can have every little thing<br>
Robots at our beckon call<br>
Then I want one robot to keep track of the remote...<br>
...And another one to scratch my balls<br>
<br>
I wanna have Robot beer That autopours in my mouth<br>
I wanna have A robot football coach,<br>
to figure my fantasy drafts out<br>
I wanna have A robot wife<br>
To automatically take my last name<br>
I long for the singularity<br>
As long as everything stays pretty much the same<br>
<br>
Elon MuskThe fella from Tesla thinks The singularity's a bad scene<br>
But Kurt Sloan and Stephen Hawking both agree<br>
It is the dawn of the spiritual machine<br>
<br>
Now I don't give a shit about that<br>
If life is real or a digital facade<br>
Hell the robots can have all heaven and earth<br>
As long as they worship my God...<br>
<br>
...Cuz I just wanna have A robot Nascar<br>
runnin' on Robot gas<br>
And if that race gets a little too tedious<br>
I can program a robot crash<br>
I wanna have A robot rifle<br>
So I can shoot at robot game<br>
I long for the singularity as long as everything stays pretty much the same<br>
Beer.<br>
I long for the singularity as long as everything stays pretty much the same...<br>
...Where's my autobeer?<br>
