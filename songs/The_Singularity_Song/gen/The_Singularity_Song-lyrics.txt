There's a concept in computing,
About a growth that's unrestrained
The exponential rate of computer processing means
all of them computers have brains

Super intelligent nano-machines,
Self aware by 2045,
Either civilization is in total peace or
none of us'll be alive

Well I hope the robots are nice,
A benevolent technology
If I have to report to a robot boss
Well I wanna few things for me...

...I wanna have Robot beer
That autopours in my mouth
I wanna have A robot football coach
To figure my fantasy drafts out
I wanna have A robot lawn
To ride my robot mower on
The dawn of the singularity is the age for which I Iong

If we can have every little thing
Robots at our beckon call
Then I want one robot to keep track of the remote...
...And another one to scratch my balls

I wanna have Robot beer That autopours in my mouth
I wanna have A robot football coach,
to figure my fantasy drafts out
I wanna have A robot wife
To automatically take my last name
I long for the singularity
As long as everything stays pretty much the same

Elon MuskThe fella from Tesla thinks The singularity's a bad scene
But Kurt Sloan and Stephen Hawking both agree
It is the dawn of the spiritual machine

Now I don't give a shit about that
If life is real or a digital facade
Hell the robots can have all heaven and earth
As long as they worship my God...

...Cuz I just wanna have A robot Nascar
runnin' on Robot gas
And if that race gets a little too tedious
I can program a robot crash
I wanna have A robot rifle
So I can shoot at robot game
I long for the singularity as long as everything stays pretty much the same
Beer.
I long for the singularity as long as everything stays pretty much the same...
...Where's my autobeer?
