<p>Doing things is great. This song encourages people to, on the margin, do more things, even if some of the things they try fail. It’s an anthem to persistance and a ward against discouragement. It’s also a catchy pop song.</p>
<p>"Hermione felt a stab of disappointment. She really wished she wouldn’t have felt that way, the boy wasn’t a teacher, but it was still a test and she’d gotten a question wrong and that always felt like a little punch in the stomach.</p>
<p>(It said almost everything you needed to know about Hermione Granger that she had never let that stop her, or even let it interfere with her love of being tested.)" -HPMOR</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
I messed up tonight, I lost another fight<br>
Lost to myself, but I'll just start again<br>
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground<br>
I always get up now, see what's next<br>
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up<br>
Nobody learns without gettin' it wrong<br>
I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br>
'Til I reach the end, and then I'll start again<br>
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything<br>
I wanna try even though I could fail<br>
I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br>
'Til I reach the end, and then I'll start again<br>
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything<br>
I wanna try even though I could fail<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Try everything<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Try everything<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Try everything<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Look how far you've come, you filled your heart with love<br>
Baby, you've done enough, take a deep breath<br>
Don't beat yourself up, no need to run so fast<br>
Sometimes we come last, but we did our best<br>
I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br>
'Til I reach the end, and then I'll start again<br>
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything<br>
I wanna try even though I could fail<br>
I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br>
'Til I reach the end, and then I'll start again<br>
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything<br>
I wanna try even though I could fail<br>
I'll keep on making those new mistakes<br>
I'll keep on making them every day<br>
Those new mistakes<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Try everything<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Try everything<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Try everything<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Try everything<br>
