#  Sogno Di Volare: The Dream of Flight
## By Christopher Tin
## Man will be lifted by his own creation, filling the universe with wonder and glory

Written for the video game Civilization VI.

The lyrics are sometimes credited to Leonardo da Vinci.  According to [the composer's website](https://christophertin.com/projects/civilizationvi.html), they were merely based on a da Vinci quote, specifically:

> For once you have tasted flight, you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long to return.

This quote [cannot be found in any primary sources, nor any secondary sources older than 1965](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Leonardo_da_Vinci#Once_you_have_tasted_flight), when it appears in an unfootnoted documentary.  So the lyrics probably have nothing to do with da Vinci at all.

A performance by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Angel City Corale is [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j2s4EkR36A).
