#  Uplift
## By Andrew Eigel
## Human progress, from stone tools to space colonies

We often blend the end of this into the beginning of Five Thousand Years.

Sometimes the final verse is altered to "*Tools* make the tools" and "*Drones* track the herd", on the logic that colonizing other worlds will involve solving ancient challenges again, but not reverting to ancient limitations.  We can expect future history to rhyme, but not to outright repeat itself.  The [2020 version](../Uplift-2020.mp3) has this change.
