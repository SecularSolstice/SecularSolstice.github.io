<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  A land of tit for tatters<br>
  Is what we'd hoped to be<br>
  But time and place and circumstance<br>
  Don't bend so easily<br>
<br>
  Our knowledge isn't perfect<br>
  Of all that went before<br>
  And just a single false defect<br>
  Begets eternal war<br>
<br>
  Our cities swell with people<br>
  Until the bulk you chance to meet<br>
  Are not ones you will meet again<br>
  In market, field or street.<br>
<br>
  Or there may come a meeting<br>
  With risk and consequence so vast<br>
  They render hardly relevant<br>
  What comes once they've gone past<br>
<br>
  Some dare to do us wrong here<br>
  Does all this risk belong near?<br>
  How can we move along? We're...<br>
<br>
  We're...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    We're living in a one shot.  One Shot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    It's unforgiving it's a one shot. One Shot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    It's sink or swimming with a one shot.  One shot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    One...<br>
<br>
  One way we might resolve this<br>
  Would be to read each others' source<br>
  But thinly slicing living brains<br>
  Has issues, yes, of course.<br>
<br>
  And if our minds were simpler<br>
  So we could parse another's thought<br>
  That also might just make them simple<br>
  Such that we could not<br>
<br>
  I don't think this is solved now<br>
  We wish that we'd evolved how<br>
  This still is not resolved now....<br>
<br>
  Now<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    We're living in a one shot.  One Shot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    It's unforgiving it's a one shot. One Shot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    It's sink or swimming with a one shot.  One shot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    One...<br>
<br>
  shot<br>
