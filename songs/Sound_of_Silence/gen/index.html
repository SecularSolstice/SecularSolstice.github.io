<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPmjoMk25g">original version</a> from 1964 used only acoustic guitar as accompaniment and, while it did build in energy, kept the darkness in the song centered. It was a commercial flop and remains obscure.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fWyzwo1xg0">1965 remix</a> added electric guitar and drums, increasing the energy and pushing the darkness into an undertone. It was a tremendous commercial success and remains widely known.</p>
<p>In 2015, the band Disturbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4">covered the song</a> with Paul Simonâ€™s blessing. They transposed it into a minor key, slowed the tempo, simplified the instrumentation and turned the energy into that of pain.</p>
<p>In 2020 Laura Vaughan and Oberon Oberon Dixon-Luinenburg (?) produced a <a href="Sound-of-Silence-2020.mp3">solstice version</a> which used only piano for accompaniment, and combined an extra low accompaniment with an extra high vocal line for added creepiness. <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2020/04-sounds-of-silence--2020-12-20-013833.mp3">A recording of this from the 2020 North American Distributed Chorus</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Hello darkness, my old friend<br>
I've come to talk with you again<br>
Because a vision softly creeping<br>
Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
Still remains<br>
Within the sound of silence<br>
<br>
In restless dreams I walked alone<br>
Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br>
I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
That split the night<br>
And touched the sound of silence<br>
<br>
And in the naked light, I saw<br>
Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
People talking without speaking<br>
People hearing without listening<br>
People writing songs that voices never share<br>
And no one dared<br>
Disturb the sound of silence<br>
<br>
"Fools", said I, "You do not know<br>
Silence like a cancer grows<br>
Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
Take my arms that I might reach you"<br>
But my words, like silent raindrops fell<br>
And echoed<br>
In the wells of silence<br>
<br>
And the people bowed and prayed<br>
To the neon god they made<br>
And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
In the words that it was forming<br>
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls<br>
And tenement halls"<br>
And whispered in the sound of silence<br>
</p>
