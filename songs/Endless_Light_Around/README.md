#  Endless Light Around Me
## By Raymond Arnold
## The second part of a song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities

This is basically the last two verses of [Endless
Light](../../Endless_Light/gen/).  I split it just so that it would
stop fighting with Brighter than Today for the Dawn slot, of which
there is really only one.


The instrumental opening gives us a chance to pull the first half into
our minds.  We can use the
[motif](Endless_Light_Around-motif.pdf) we established there,
as well as repeating
[the ending melody](Endless_Light_Around-ending-melody.pdf).
Between those, (which are available on
[one page](Endless_Light_Around-both-snippets.pdf))
we should be able to pick up where we left off pretty smoothly.
