#  Endless Light Above Me
## By Raymond Arnold
## The first part of a song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities

This is basically the first verse of [Endless
Light](../../Endless_Light/gen/).  I split it just so that it would
stop fighting with Brighter than Today for the Dawn slot, of which
there is really only one.

Because this is a split song, we want to recognize its reappearance,
even though we've heard a lot of other themes in between.  And we want
that recognition to come from the instrumental lead-in, before the
singer enters.  To do that, let us use *this* song to establish a
[piano motif](../../Endless_Light_Around/gen/Endless_Light_Around-motif.pdf).
This especially goes under the slow
descents ("Endless lights", "Untold stories", etc.)
