 Brother is quietly holding her tight 
 Hurrying home and I hope there's still time for 
 One... more... night... 
 Slowly she turns... opens her eyes 
 Struggles to stand point to the sky 
 Barely can breathe but she's telling the stor-ies 
 One... last... time... 
And she whispers of hunters and dra-gons and gods 
 Wanderers roaming the stars up a - bove 
 Holding her hand in that moment I wonder, 
 Can't help but wonder at all... those... 
 End... less... lights... burning with
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them
 One... more... reason to wonder
Is anyone out there,is anyone out there?
 anyone out there tonight
