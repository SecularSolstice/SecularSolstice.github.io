Mama's been waiting, huddled outside.
Brother is quietly holding her tight
Hurrying home and I hope there's still time for
One... more... night...

Slowly she turns... opens her eyes
Struggles to stand... point to the sky
Barely can breathe but she's telling the stories
One... last... time...

And she whispers of hunters and dragons and gods
Wanderers roaming the stars up above
Holding her hand in that moment I wonder,
Can't help but wonder at all... those...

Endless lights, burning with untold stories,
Each of them one more reason to wonder
Is anyone out there, is anyone out there?

Anyone out there tonight?
