<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
When you attend a funeral,<br>
It is sad to think that sooner or<br>
Later those you love will do the same for you.<br>
And you may have thought it tragic,<br>
Not to mention other adjec-<br>
Tives, to think of all the weeping they will do.<br>
But don't you worry.<br>
No more ashes, no more sackcloth.<br>
And an armband made of black cloth<br>
Will some day never more adorn a sleeve.<br>
For if the bomb that drops on you<br>
Gets your friends and neighbors too,<br>
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve.<br>
<br>
And we will all go together when we go.<br>
What a comforting fact that is to know.<br>
Universal bereavement,<br>
An inspiring achievement,<br>
Yes, we all will go together when we go.<br>
<br>
We will all go together when we go.<br>
All suffuse with an incandescent glow.<br>
No one will have the endurance<br>
To collect on his insurance,<br>
Lloyd's of london will be loaded when they go.<br>
<br>
Oh we will all fry together when we fry.<br>
We'll be french fried potatoes by and by.<br>
There will be no more misery<br>
When the world is our rotisserie,<br>
Yes, we will all fry together when we fry.<br>
<br>
Down by the old maelstrom,<br>
There'll be a storm before the calm.<br>
<br>
And we will all bake together when we bake.<br>
There'll be nobody present at the wake.<br>
With complete participation<br>
In that grand incineration,<br>
Nearly three billion hunks of well-done steak.<br>
<br>
Oh we will all char together when we char.<br>
And let there be no moaning of the bar.<br>
Just sing out a te deum<br>
When you see that I. C. B. M.,<br>
And the party will be "come as you are."<br>
<br>
Oh we will all burn together when we burn.<br>
There'll be no need to stand and wait your turn.<br>
When it's time for the fallout<br>
And saint peter calls us all out,<br>
We'll just drop our agendas and adjourn.<br>
<br>
You will all go directly to your respective valhallas.<br>
Go directly, do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dolla's.<br>
<br>
And we will all go together when we go.<br>
Ev'ry hottenhot and ev'ry eskimo.<br>
When the air becomes uranious,<br>
And we will all go simultaneous.<br>
Yes we all will go together<br>
When we all go together,<br>
Yes we all will go together when we go.<br>
