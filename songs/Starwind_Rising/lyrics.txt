Chorus:
    And there's a starwind rising
    Stretching the skyward sails
    Earthborn seeds fly outward
    Let the stars beware

Feel the stirring in the time-ripe world
See old Gaia smile
Knowing the seed-pod will spring open
In only a little while

    Chorus

Ancient and long the chain (?) that held us
Tied to the old world's ground
Vast the ancient plan that leads us
To a universe unbound

    Chorus

Warn your (?) lords of the endless star ways
See your ways undone
Gaia's ferry of (?) children spring
From their prison 'neath the changing sun

   Chorus

Fear the end so long-awaited
As the change of old kind breaks free
Come to break your status with a change
As ever was meant to be

   Chorus
