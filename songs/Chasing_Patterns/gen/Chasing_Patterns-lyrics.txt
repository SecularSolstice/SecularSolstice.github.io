Chasing patterns in the sky...  Trace the line from star to star
Look around and wonder why...  Where we going who we are
Vernal flower, summer breeze...  Cricket wing and autumn leaves
Fractal patterns, golden mean Whispers of a world unseen.
Looking for a signal... hidden in the noise 
Where we come from, where we going? Where we come from, where we going?
Looking for an answer... to give the girls and boys, asking 
Where we come from, where we going? Where we come from, where we going?
Oh... Where we come from, where we going?
Oh... 
Chasing patterns in the sky Feeling lost, alone and small
Birds depart and crickets die Frost encroaching, winter falls
Track the omens, year by year Fit the pieces, best you can
Tell a story they can hear Something we can understand
Looking for a signal... hidden in the noise 
Where we come from, where we going? Where we come from, where we going?
Looking for an answer... to give the girls and boys, asking 
Where we come from, where we going? Where we come from, where we going?
Oh... Where we come from, where we going?
Oh... 
Chasing patterns in the sky Seasons turn and stories change
Weather vane and satellite Rising tide and hurricane
Spiral Arm and Golden Mean Trace the line from star to star
Seeking worlds yet unseen Where we going, who we are?
Where we going, who we are?
