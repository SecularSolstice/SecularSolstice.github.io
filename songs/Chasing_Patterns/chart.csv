"Chasing Patterns",,,,,,,
"This whole song hangs out on a E chord",,,,,,"G# - A - B - E       ......  B - G# A G# E",
,,,,,,,
"Verse I: Just guitar and piano",,,,,,"Chasing patterns in the sky... ","Trace the line from star to star"
,,,,,,"Look around and wonder why... ","Where we going who we are"
,,,,,,"Vernal flower, summer breeze... ","Cricket wing and autumn leaves"
,,,,,,"Fractal patterns, golden mean","Whispers of a world unseen."
"Chorus: Add in Cello/Bass",,,,,,"Looking for a signal... hidden in the noise",
,,,,,,"Where we come from, where we going?","Where we come from, where we going?"
,,,,,,"Looking for an answer... to give the girls and boys, asking",
,,,,,,"Where we come from, where we going?","Where we come from, where we going?"
,,,,,,Oh...,"Where we come from, where we going?"
,,,,,,Oh...,
"Verse 2 - Add drums",,,,,,"Chasing patterns in the sky","Feeling lost, alone and small"
,,,,,,"Birds depart and crickets die","Frost encroaching, winter falls"
,,,,,,"Track the omens, year by year","Fit the pieces, best you can"
,,,,,,"Tell a story they can hear","Something we can understand"
"Chorus - More intense",,,,,,"Looking for a signal... hidden in the noise",
,,,,,,"Where we come from, where we going?","Where we come from, where we going?"
,,,,,,"Looking for an answer... to give the girls and boys, asking",
,,,,,,"Where we come from, where we going?","Where we come from, where we going?"
,,,,,,Oh...,"Where we come from, where we going?"
,,,,,,Oh...,
"Verse 3: Get much quieter, remove drums",,,,,,"Chasing patterns in the sky","Seasons turn and stories change"
,,,,,,"Weather vane and satellite","Rising tide and hurricane"
,,,,,,"Spiral Arm and Golden Mean","Trace the line from star to star"
,,,,,,"Seeking worlds yet unseen","Where we going, who we are?"
"Repeat and fade out",,,,,,"Where we going, who we are?",
