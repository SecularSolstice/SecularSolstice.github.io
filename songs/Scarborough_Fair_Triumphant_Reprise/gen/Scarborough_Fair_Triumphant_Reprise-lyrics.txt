Will you celebrate down by a bay
Emeralds apples cradles and waves
Remember me to one who did stay
We're to be the ones that she saves

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (Please not the woolen the worst of them all)
Emeralds apples cradles and waves (See how it itches and pricks at my skin)
Without no seam nor needle work (Bent over welding machines to create)
We're to be the ones that she saves (Sleeps in the silence of awe at her work)

Tell her to find me an acre of land (Beautiful meadows we'll garden ourselves)
Emeralds apples cradles and waves (No physical place but a network of steel)
Between the salt water and the sea strands (Listen as whispers and laughter cross seas)
We're to be the ones that she saves (Setting the stage for what's more to be done)

Tell her to show us a way to be good (oohs)
Emeralds apples cradles and waves (oohs)
One where we can do what we should (oohs)
We're to be the ones that she saves (oohs)

Will you celebrate down by a bay
Emeralds apples cradles and waves
Remember me to one who did stay
We're to be the ones that she saves
