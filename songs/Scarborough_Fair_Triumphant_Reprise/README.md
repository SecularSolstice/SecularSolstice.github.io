#  Scarborough Fair Triumphant Reprise
## By Tricky Talks (?)
## A return of sorts to Scarborough Fair

Melody should be as usual, including syllabic stress on first line (ARE you GOing to SCAR bourough FAIR -> WILL you CEL-ebrate DOWN by a BAY)

Notes for countermelody (assume E minor):    
Line 1: D  C  B  C  B  A  B  A  G  E3(or A3)    
Line 2: G4 A  F# F# E  F# G  F# D  E    
Line 3: G3 A  B  C  B  A  B  A  G  A    
Line 4: A  B  C  D  C  B  C  B  G  A

[Editor's note: I tried to transcibe the melody above into [sheet music](Scarborough_Fair_Triumphant_Reprise-countermelody-sheet-music.pdf) but am not confident I did it correctly.  If I did, then the range will be an issue for many singers.]

To Sing: 

Option 1:

Divide room into two groups. First group sings regular melody, led by
Singer One, who has a microphone. Second group sings the
countermelody, led by Singer Two, who also has a microphone.

For the verses with words or sounds in parentheses, the first group
led by singer one will sing the words not in parentheses. The second
group led by singer two will then sing the words in parentheses. They
will continue to alternate for all verses where there is both a melody
and a countermelody, and will join together for the last verse,
singing the melody in unison.

Option 2:

Same as Option 1, except the entire group plus Singer One sings the
regular melody, and the only person singing the countermelody is
Singer Two.
