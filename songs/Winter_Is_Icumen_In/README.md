# Winter Is Icumen In
## By Ezra Pound
## A lament of the coming season, in anachronistic language

Based on [Sumer Is Icumen
In](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer_Is_Icumen_In) a 13th century
English Rota, and the oldest surviving song of its kind.

As such, this can be useful at breaking people out of the present.  At
least if they're familiar with the source material.  Which was
referenced in a Pratchett novel, so that helps.

A [Bayesian Choir Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf-Ma4tv_yQ) of this song is on Youtube.
