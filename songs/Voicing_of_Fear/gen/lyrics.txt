  Is there some one out there to hear?
  The voicing of my endless fear:
  that all I love will fade like grass,
  before the darkness drawing near.
  
  I beg each season to return,
  The wise to teach, the young to learn,
  The sand to stay beneath my feet,
  That not the towns and oceans burn.

  May I survive my wanderlust,
  With time for love and for what is just
  May I afford a chance to play.
  To live more life than what I must.
  
  All hope is silent to me still
  I gird my heart and set my skill
  'Cause someone must and no one will
  'Cause someone must and no one will
