<p>This song speaks of X-risks and S-risks.</p>
<p>It’s a <em>big</em> song. It needs to be paired with something
personal. It must <em>not</em> be paired with Stopping in the Woods
because the harmonies are too similar.</p>
<p>The heart of the song is the middle. The second stanza speaks of all
that might be destroyed. It does not speak of specific dangers, only
treats the sand beneath our feet as less of a certainty and more of a
desperate hope. The third stanza speaks of human values, which could be
destroyed by over-optimization even if our lives aren’t (a prospect I
for one find <em>more</em> frightening).</p>
<p>The ending very deliberately drops the “else” from The Comet King’s
motto (“Someone must and no one else will”). This is, AFAICT, the actual
viewpoint of most X-risk mitigators. MIRI doesn’t say “we can do this”,
only “no one else is trying”.</p>
<p>I tried to make it timeless. It should fit a neolithic farmer facing
winter or a MIRI researcher facing endgame (whatever that turns out to
be). I think it mostly succeeds. The bit about oceans burning isn’t very
neolithic, but induction without a model is hard, so maybe it is
something you have to worry about if you can’t get a chemistry
textbook.</p>
<p>If you’re using this song, make sure to get the sheet music to the
pianist early, so they have enough time to learn and rehearse it – and
to raise an objection if necessary. Thus far every pianist who’s taken
it on has managed, but the part is more difficult than most of what we
have here.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of the sheet music used lots of eighth notes, which
tended to mislead pianists into playing to quickly. So it was
reformatted in quarter notes, leaving a bunch of double-whole notes in
the piano harmony. Here’s hoping lilypond’s right about that
notation.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
  Is there some one out there to hear?<br>
  The voicing of my endless fear:<br>
  that all I love will fade like grass,<br>
  before the darkness drawing near.<br>
<br>
  I beg each season to return,<br>
  The wise to teach, the young to learn,<br>
  The sand to stay beneath my feet,<br>
  That not the towns and oceans burn.<br>
<br>
  May I survive my wanderlust,<br>
  With time for love and for what is just<br>
  May I afford a chance to play.<br>
  To live more life than what I must.<br>
<br>
  All hope is silent to me still<br>
  I gird my heart and set my skill<br>
  'Cause someone must and no one will<br>
  'Cause someone must and no one will<br>
</p>
