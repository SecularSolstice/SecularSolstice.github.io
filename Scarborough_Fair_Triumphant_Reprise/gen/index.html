<p>Melody should be as usual, including syllabic stress on first line (ARE you GOing to SCAR bourough FAIR -&gt; WILL you CEL-ebrate DOWN by a BAY)</p>
<p>Notes for countermelody (assume E minor):<br />
Line 1: D C B C B A B A G E3(or A3)<br />
Line 2: G4 A F# F# E F# G F# D E<br />
Line 3: G3 A B C B A B A G A<br />
Line 4: A B C D C B C B G A</p>
<p>[Editor's note: I tried to transcibe the melody above into <a href="Scarborough_Fair_Triumphant_Reprise-countermelody-sheet-music.pdf">sheet music</a> but am not confident I did it correctly. If I did, then the range will be an issue for many singers.]</p>
<p>To Sing:</p>
<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>Divide room into two groups. First group sings regular melody, led by Singer One, who has a microphone. Second group sings the countermelody, led by Singer Two, who also has a microphone.</p>
<p>For the verses with words or sounds in parentheses, the first group led by singer one will sing the words not in parentheses. The second group led by singer two will then sing the words in parentheses. They will continue to alternate for all verses where there is both a melody and a countermelody, and will join together for the last verse, singing the melody in unison.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>Same as Option 1, except the entire group plus Singer One sings the regular melody, and the only person singing the countermelody is Singer Two.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Will you celebrate down by a bay<br>
Emeralds apples cradles and waves<br>
Remember me to one who did stay<br>
We're to be the ones that she saves<br>
<br>
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (Please not the woolen the worst of them all)<br>
Emeralds apples cradles and waves (See how it itches and pricks at my skin)<br>
Without no seam nor needle work (Bent over welding machines to create)<br>
We're to be the ones that she saves (Sleeps in the silence of awe at her work)<br>
<br>
Tell her to find me an acre of land (Beautiful meadows we'll garden ourselves)<br>
Emeralds apples cradles and waves (No physical place but a network of steel)<br>
Between the salt water and the sea strands (Listen as whispers and laughter cross seas)<br>
We're to be the ones that she saves (Setting the stage for what's more to be done)<br>
<br>
Tell her to show us a way to be good (oohs)<br>
Emeralds apples cradles and waves (oohs)<br>
One where we can do what we should (oohs)<br>
We're to be the ones that she saves (oohs)<br>
<br>
Will you celebrate down by a bay<br>
Emeralds apples cradles and waves<br>
Remember me to one who did stay<br>
We're to be the ones that she saves<br>
