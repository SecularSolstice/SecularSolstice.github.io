Feet move the tribe track the   herd with a will   
Human-kind struggles, on the edge of histo ry
Time to settle  down, time to  grow, time to breed..

Plow tills the soil, plants the seed, pray for rain   
Scythe reaps the wheat, to the  mill, to grind the grain   
Towns.. and.. cities spread to  empire over - night   
Hands keep    building as we   chant the ancient rite...

Coal heats the steam, push the piston, turns the wheel   
Cogs spin the wool, drives the horses made of steel   
Lightning harnessed does our will and lights the dark   
Keep rising   higher,  set our  goal, hit the mark...

Crawl.. out..  of...  the  mud.   
On...   go... ing...  but slow.   
For the path...  that  is    easy 
Ain't the one... that... makes us grow

Light push the sails, read the  data, cities  glow   
Hands type the keys, tap the screen, out we go!   
Our voices carry round the world and into space   
Send us out to colonize another place.

Hands, make the tools, light fire, plant the grain   
Feet, track the herd. Build a world. Begin again...
