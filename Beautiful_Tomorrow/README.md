#  Beautiful Tomorrow
## By Evgeny Krylatov (Music), Yuri Entin (Original Lyrics) and Anna Tchetchetkine et. al. (English Translation)
## Tomorrow calls to me

To put this song in some historical context:

In 1968, Russian author Kir Bulychev began a series of scifi/adventure children's books entitled [Alice, Girl from the Future](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceGirlFromTheFuture).  Set in the late 21st century, they depicted Earth as a high-tech communist utopia but the rest of the galaxy rather less so -- hence adventure

In 1978, he wrote the fourth book: Alice in the Past, in which his hero traveled through time to the 20th century.

In 1984, Soviet Central Television converted this novel into a five-episode miniseries entitled [Guest from the Future](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuestFromTheFuture).  This was the theme song.

In 2018, Anna Tchetchetkine and the Bayesian Choir translated the song into English and arranged it for the choir.
