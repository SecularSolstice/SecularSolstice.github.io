<h2 id="the-first-part-of-a-song-of-hope-generations-stories-and-infinite-possibilities">The first part of a song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities</h2>
<p>This is basically the first verse of <a href="../../Endless_Light/gen/">Endless Light</a>. I split it just so that it would stop fighting with Brighter than Today for the Dawn slot, of which there is really only one.</p>
<p>Because this is a split song, we want to recognize its reappearance, even though we've heard a lot of other themes in between. And we want that recognition to come from the instrumental lead-in, before the singer enters. To do that, let us use <em>this</em> song to establish a <a href="../../Endless_Light_Around/gen/Endless_Light_Around-motif.pdf">piano motif</a>. This especially goes under the slow descents (&quot;Endless lights&quot;, &quot;Untold stories&quot;, etc.)</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Mama's been waiting, huddled out - side.<br>
 Brother is quietly holding her tight<br>
 Hurrying home and I hope there's still time for<br>
 One... more... night...<br>
 Slowly she turns... opens her eyes<br>
 Struggles to stand point to the sky<br>
 Barely can breathe but she's telling the stor-ies<br>
 One... last... time...<br>
And she whispers of hunters and dra-gons and gods<br>
 Wanderers roaming the stars up a - bove<br>
 Holding her hand in that moment I wonder,<br>
 Can't help but wonder at all... those...<br>
 End... less... lights... burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there,is anyone out there?<br>
 anyone out there tonight<br>
</p>
