#  Endless Light Around Me
## By Raymond Arnold
## The second part of a song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities

This is basically the last two verses of [Endless
Light](../../Endless_Light/gen/).  I split it just so that it would
stop fighting with Brighter than Today for the Dawn slot, of which
there is really only one.


The instrumental opening gives us a chance to pull the first half into
our minds.  We can use the
[motif](../../Endless_Light_Above/gen/motif.pdf) we established there,
as well as repeating [the ending melody](ending-melody.pdf).  Between
those, we should be able to pick up where we left off pretty smoothly.
