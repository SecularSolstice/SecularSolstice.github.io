<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<h2 id="the-second-part-of-a-song-of-hope-generations-stories-and-infinite-possibilities">The second part of a song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities</h2>
<p>This is basically the last two verses of <a href="../../Endless_Light/gen/">Endless Light</a>. I split it just so that it would stop fighting with Brighter than Today for the Dawn slot, of which there is really only one.</p>
<p>The instrumental opening gives us a chance to pull the first half into our minds. We can use the <a href="Endless_Light_Around-motif.pdf">motif</a> we established there, as well as repeating <a href="Endless_Light_Around-ending-melody.pdf">the ending melody</a>. Between those, (which are available on <a href="Endless_Light_Around-both-snippets.pdf">one page</a>) we should be able to pick up where we left off pretty smoothly.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
 Father is waiting for sister and me<br>
 Thousands of miles away, over the sea and we're<br>
 Flying as fast as the Boeing'll carry us<br>
 One... last... time...<br>
 Thinking of stories he told from the war<br>
 Terrible jokes that he made us endure<br>
 Daylight is ending, the plane is descending<br>
 Just... in... time... ... as the<br>
 clouds part around us, a dazz-l-ing city<br>
A ppears like a jewel in the night...<br>
And I look at our home and its lights all a - glow'n and I<br>
 Can't help but wonder at all.. those...<br>
 End... less... lights, burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there, anyone out there?<br>
 End... less... night cradling<br>
 Count... less... voices, reaching<br>
A cross.. the vast-ness...<br>
With beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can...<br>
 Beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can...<br>
<br>
 Grandma's been waiting for clues in the dark, and I'm<br>
 Journeying millions of miles to take part.<br>
And finally I see her glint in the viewing port,<br>
 Right... on... time...<br>
 Weightless em brace as the airlock re- seals,<br>
 Space station turning and slowly re- veals:<br>
 Rows upon rows of her telescopes listening<br>
 Deep... through... time... C F<br>
And maybe there's some kind of somebody o-ut there<br>
 Listening in on our radio calls<br>
Or maybe there's not there's just one pale blue dot to give<br>
 Meaning and beauty and worth to it all.<br>
But holding her hand in that moment I wonder,<br>
 Can't help but wonder at all wonder at all... those...<br>
 End... less... lights, burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there... anyone out there?<br>
 End... less... night cradling<br>
 Count... less... voices, reaching<br>
A cross... the vast-ness...<br>
With beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can...<br>
 beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can...<br>
 beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they long as they<br>
 can<br>
