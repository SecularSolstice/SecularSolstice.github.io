<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Countless winter nights ago,<br>
A woman shivered in the cold.<br>
Cursed the skies, and wondered why<br>
The gods invented pain.<br>
<br>
Aching angry flesh and bone,<br>
Bitterly she struck the stone<br>
Till she saw the sudden spark<br>
Of light, and golden flame.<br>
<br>
She showed the others, but they told her<br>
She was not fit to control<br>
The primal forces that the gods<br>
Had cloaked in mystery<br>
<br>
But she would not be satisfied,<br>
And though she trembled, she defied them<br>
Took her torch and raised it high<br>
Set afire history.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  although the night is cold.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The stars may seem so very far a-way...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But courage, hope and reason burn,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In every mind, each lesson learned,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Shining light to guide our way<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Make tomorrow brighter than to-day...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Oh... Brighter than to-day.<br>
<br>
Ages long forgotten now,<br>
We built the wheel and then the plough.<br>
Tilled the earth and proved our worth,<br>
Against the drought and snow.<br>
<br>
Soon we had the time to fathom<br>
Mountain peaks and tiny atoms,<br>
Beating hearts electric sparks<br>
So much more to know.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  although the night is cold.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The stars may seem so very far a-way...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But courage, hope and reason grow<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  With every passing season so we’ll<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Drive the darkness far away<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Make tomorrow brighter than to-day...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Oh... Brighter than to-day.<br>
<br>
The universe may seem unfair.<br>
The laws of nature may not care.<br>
The storms and quakes, our own mistakes,<br>
They nearly doused our flame.<br>
<br>
But all these trials we’ve endured<br>
The lessons learned, diseases cured<br>
Against our herculean task<br>
We’ve risen to proclaim.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  although the night is cold.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The stars may seem so very far a-way...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But courage, hope and reason bloom<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Across the world and one day soon, we’ll<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Rise up to the stars and say:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Make tomorrow brighter than today<br>
