# Boston 2016 Opening Speech
## By Jim Babcock

Like most things, winter was once a mystery. The world grew cold, and
dark. The sun withdrew, leaving us with only the pale moon, and stars
that lay unimaginably far away. Life became fragile. People died. And
they didn’t understand what was happening, or why. They desperately
threw festivals in honor of sun gods with all-too-human motivations,
and prayed for the light’s return.

It didn’t work. (Although we did learn that throwing giant parties in
the middle of winter is an excellent idea.) But then, something
incredible happened. We studied the sky. We invented astronomy, and
agriculture. We began a long journey towards truly understanding our
place in the universe. And we used that understanding to make our
world better.

Thousands of years later, winter isn’t so scary. But the symbol of the
solstice - the departure and return of the sun, is still powerful. The
work we’ve done to transform winter from a bleak season of darkness
into a festival of light deserves a holiday with all the reverence of
an ancient cultural cornerstone.

Good evening everyone, and welcome to Secular Solstice.

Imagine a world where religion was never even a thing. Nobody ever
made things up when they didn’t know the answer. They just said “I
dunno?” until they figured it out. Nobody prayed for rain. Atheism
wasn’t a word anyone ever bothered to invent. What kind of holidays
did they celebrate anyway?

Six years ago, the rationality community wanted to celebrate a winter
holiday. And not a glib, tongue-in-cheek affair like Seinfeld’s
Festivus (“for the rest of us!”), or a sarcastic tribute to the Flying
Spaghetti Monster. We can be silly and sarcastic sometimes, but we
also wanted to take time to reflect seriously on ideas that were
important to us. Atheist culture lends itself well to ridiculing
something silly, but hasn’t done as well at helping people experience
wonder together.

And so a living tradition was born: each winter, we get together to
sing, and to contemplate our place in the universe. I became part of
this tradition in 2012, at Ray Arnold’s New York secular Solstice; and
in 2013 I organized one in Boston. And each year, we build upon that
tradition, and sing something a little different.

Thousands… no, hundreds of years ago, the world seemed vast and empty;
you could go out to a frontier, where there weren’t many people and
build what would become that place’s future. But then the Internet
connected everything, and the world seemed to shrink; the frontiers
became less obvious, and perhaps less literal.

Internet communities are still looking for colonists. The intellectual
frontiers are more open than ever. And it was just this year that the
first Falcon 9 returned from space.

If you haven’t been to a Secular Solstice before, you might be asking
yourself: What exactly are we, as secular humanists, doing here, in
this building which is for ostensibly religious services,
participating in a ritual which includes readings and group singing
and other elements that sound suspiciously like a religious service?

If you have been to a Secular Solstice before, then go ahead and ask
yourself that question anyway, because I think it turns out to be kind
of a deep question.

Religion has been a feature of most human societies for the past
12,000 years or so, though some aspects of it are older. We don’t
entirely understand how it began. One story, which you may have heard
before if you attended a previous Solstice in New York, is that human
brains have evolved to be good at dealing with other humans, so when
early humans encountered natural phenomena like the weather, they
tended to attribute them to human-like agents—the gods. And so they
would start asking these gods for things like a good harvest, and over
time these prayers and practices evolved into religion as we know it
today.

It’s a neat story, but it’s not the whole story. Why the social
aspects of religion? Why pray and sing and have all these rituals in
public, with other people? Why isn’t religion just a personal thing?

Perhaps—and I’m not an anthropologist, I don’t know how much agreement
there is on this among experts—but perhaps religion helped tribes to
coordinate.

Rituals and music served to provide group bonding experiences. Myths
and legends helped give the tribe a sense of shared purpose. Religious
laws and commandments helped them live harmoniously with one another
Taken together, these factors could help make the members of a tribe
more able to trust one another, to cooperate in prisoner’s
dilemmas. And perhaps those tribes that could do this were rewarded
with a greater ability to survive and reproduce than those that could
not.

And sometimes, they were able to coordinate to do more than just
that. Sometimes, they were able to do things like spend hundreds of
years dragging hundreds of tons of stones over 150 miles to build
something like Stonehenge, the ancient archaeological wonder. We don’t
fully understand why Stonehenge was built, though it seems to have had
some kind of ritual purpose. One theory, which has garnered a fair bit
of academic support, is that Stonehenge was a place of healing. These
ancient people coordinated to bring this place into existence so that
the sick and injured could be ritually healed there, through the power
of ringing sounds that were made by hitting the rocks.

Unfortunately, human physiology doesn’t actually work that way, and so
these rituals didn’t really heal the sick. That’s the danger of this
kind of cultural evolution; it can only get you so far. It might be
useful to have beliefs that give you a sense of belonging with your
fellow humans, but it’d be even nicer if these beliefs were, y’know,
actually true. So that you don’t spend hundreds of years building a
healing center that doesn’t actually work. And these sorts of evolved
religions didn’t quite get there.

But of course, I’m not telling you anything here that you don’t
already know. The more interesting question for secular humanists is:
Can we get these benefits of religion—particularly, in the context of
Secular Solstice, the benefits of ritual—without giving up the
benefits that come from believing things that are actually true?

Some of us think that we can. And for the fifth year now, Secular
Solstice has been a test of that hypothesis.

One way to help make this work, of course, is to be explicit about
what exactly we’re trying to do. This wouldn’t have worked for the
early humans—they didn’t know enough about their own history or how
the universe actually functions—but it can work for us. So, instead of
praying to the gods and hoping that this incidentally brings us closer
together, I can just tell you directly that the theme for this
Solstice is coordination—the benefits it can bring us, the challenges
in making it work, and ultimately, why we as a species will need to
get better at it, if we want to survive and prosper.

Speaking of the gods…perhaps we shouldn’t dispense with them
entirely. They may not exist in a literal sense, but they can still be
useful as metaphors. An abstract concept can be easier to wrap your
head around if you give it a name and a face, as the ancients did. We
may have had more practice with high-level abstract reasoning than
they did, but this stuff is still complicated and we need all the help
we can get in understanding it. Provided, of course, that we remain
aware of what we’re doing. So in that sense, you may hear the names of
a few gods spoken as part of this ritual tonight.

So that’s why we’re here tonight. We can bring ourselves closer
together, and perhaps, in time, build our own Stonehenge—but one based
on the truths we’ve learned about the universe.
