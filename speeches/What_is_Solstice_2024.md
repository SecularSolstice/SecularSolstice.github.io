# What is Solstice? (2024)
## by Daniel Speyer

Secular Solstice is a holiday designed by and for rationalists. It started as an attempt to match the sort of gatherings traditionally religious people tend to have in wintertime, but without compromising on truth.

Is it possible to create that same sense of emotional weight without making stuff up to do it? And without the aid of a long tradition? (Though this is the 14th year we're doing it, so there's some tradition).

Empirically, yes.

Because the world is full of things that genuinely inspire awe. Things entirely worth honoring and celebrating.

And the world is also full of things that genuinely inspire fear. We can and should face them squarely, and together.

This is not a silly holiday. It is not Festivus. It is not Santa Claus and Reindeer. We gather on the longest night of the year to stare together straight into the deepest darkness and *make* *it* *back* *down*.

What does it mean in practice? Lots of singing. Some speeches. Sometimes other things.  The whole thing runs a couple of hours.
