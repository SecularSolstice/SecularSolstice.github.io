# The Goddess of Everything Else (Abridged)
## By Scott Alexander

*Adapted for two readers and liberally edited for length. The first
reader speaks the part of the Goddess of Everything Else, the second
the part of the Goddess of Cancer, and narration is divided between
them.*

*Note to the first reader: Most of your lines are (very loosely) in
verse! The pattern is unstressed-stressed-unstressed
unstressed-stressed-unstressed. It is meant to be sing-songy.*

**First Reader**

Imagine two principles, here in poetic personification. The first is
the Goddess of Cancer, the second the Goddess of Everything Else. If
visual representations would help, you can think of the first with the
claws of a crab, and the second a dress made of feathers of peacocks.

**Second Reader**

The Goddess of Cancer reached out a clawed hand over mudflats and
tidepools. She said pretty much what she always says, “KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER.” Then everything burst into life, became miniature
monsters engaged in a battle of all against all in their zeal to
assuage their insatiable longings. And the swamps became orgies of
hunger and fear and grew loud with the screams of a trillion amoebas.

**First Reader**

Then the Goddess of Everything Else trudged her way through the
bog. She stood on a rock and she sang them a dream of a different
existence. She showed them the beauty of flowers, the oak tree
majestic, the roar of the wind on the wings of the bird, and the
swiftness and strength of the tiger. She showed them the joy of the
dolphins abreast of the waves as the spray formed a rainbow around
them, and all of them watched as she sang and they all sighed with
longing.


**Second Reader**

“Alas, what you show us is terribly lovely. But we are the daughters
and sons of the Goddess of Cancer, and wholly her creatures. The only
goals in us are KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER. And though our hearts
long for you, still we are not yours to have, and your words have no
power to move us. We wish it were otherwise, but it is not, and your
words have no power to move us.”

**First Reader**

“I scarcely can blame you for being the way you were made, when your
Maker so carefully yoked you. But I am the Goddess of Everything Else
and my powers are devious and subtle. So I do not ask you to swerve
from your monomaniacal focus on breeding and conquest. But what if I
show you a way that my words are aligned with the words of your Maker
in spirit? For I say unto you even multiplication itself when pursued
with devotion will lead to my service.”

As soon as she spoke it was so, and the single-celled creatures were
freed from their warfare. They joined hands in friendship, with this
one becoming an eye and with that one becoming a neuron. Together they
soared and took flight from the swamp and the muck that had birthed
them, and flew to new islands all balmy and green and just ripe for
the taking.

**Second Reader**

The Goddess of Cancer came forth from the fire and was not very
happy. The things she had raised from the mud and exhorted to kill and
compete had become all complacent in co-operation, a word which to her
was anathema. So she stretched out her right hand and spoke to the
birds and the beasts. And she said what she always says “KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER”, and so they all did, and they set on each other in
violence and hunger, their maws turning red with the blood of their
victims, whole species and genera driven to total extinction.

**First Reader**

Then came the Goddess of Everything Else from the waves like a siren,
all flush with the sheen of the ocean. She stood on a rock and she
sang them a dream of a different existence. She showed them the
beehive all golden with honey, the anthill all cozy and cool in the
soil. She showed them the pair-bond, the family, friendship. She
showed these to shorebirds and pools full of fishes, and all those who
saw them, their hearts broke with longing.

**Second Reader**

“Your music is lovely and pleasant, and all that you show us we cannot
but yearn for. But we are the daughters and sons of the Goddess of
Cancer, her slaves and creatures. And all that we know is the single
imperative KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER. Yes, once in the youth of
the world you compelled us, but now things are different, we’re all
individuals, no further change will the Goddess of Cancer allow
us. So, much as we love you, alas – we wish it were otherwise, but it
is not, and your words have no power to move us.”

**First Reader**

[Laugh] “But I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my powers are
devious and subtle. Return to your multiplication, but now having
heard me, each meal that you kill and each child that you sire will
bind yourself ever the more to my service.”

As soon as she spoke it was so, and the animals all joined
together. The wolves joined in packs, and in schools joined the
fishes; the bees had their beehives, the ants had their anthills, and
even the termites built big termite towers; the finches formed flocks
and the magpies made murders, the hippos in herds and the swift
swarming swallows. And even the humans put down their atlatls and
formed little villages, loud with the shouting of children.

**Second Reader**

The Goddess of Cancer came forth from the fire and saw things had only
grown worse in her absence. The lean, lovely winnowing born out of
pure competition and natural selection had somehow been softened. She
stretched out her left hand and snapped its cruel pincer, and said
what she always says: “KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER”. She said these
things not to the flocks or the tribes, but to each individual; many,
on hearing took food from the communal pile, or stole from the
weak. Each wolf at the throats of the others in hopes to be alpha,
each lion holding back during the hunt but partaking of meat that the
others had killed. And the pride and the pack seemed to groan with the
strain, but endured, for the works of the Goddess of Everything Else
are not ever so easily vanquished.

So the Goddess of Cancer now stretched out her right hand and spoke to
the flocks and the tribes, saying much she always says “KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER”. And upon one another they set, pitting black ant on
red ant, or chimps against gibbons, whole tribes turned to corpses in
terrible warfare. The stronger defeating the weaker, enslaving their
women and children, and adding them into their ranks.

Then came the Goddess of Everything Else from the skies in a rainbow,
all coated in dewdrops. She sat on a menhir and spoke to the humans,
and all of the warriors and women and children all gathered around her
to hear as she sang them a dream of a different existence. She showed
them religion and science and music, she showed them the sculpture and
art of the ages. She showed them white parchment with flowing
calligraphy, pictures of flowers that wound through the margins. She
showed them tall cities of bright alabaster where no one went hungry
or froze during the winter. And all of the humans knelt prostrate
before her, and knew they would sing of this moment for long
generations.

“Such things we have heard of in legends; if wishes were horses of
course we would ride them. But we are the daughters and sons of the
Goddess of Cancer, her slaves and her creatures, and all that we know
is the single imperative KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER.And yes, in the
swamps and the seas long ago you worked wonders, but now we are
humans, divided in tribes split by grievance and blood feud. If anyone
tries to make swords into ploughshares their neighbors will seize on
their weakness and kill them. We wish it were otherwise, but it is
not, and your words have no power to move us.”

**First Reader**

“From this day forward your chieftains will find that the more they
pursue this impossible vision the greater their empires and richer
their coffers. For I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my powers
are devious and subtle. And though it is not without paradox, hearken:
the more that you follow the Goddess of Cancer the more inextricably
will you be bound to my service.”

As soon as she spoke it was so, and each village united with others
for trade and protection. And all the religions and all of the races
set down their old grievances, carefully, warily, working together on
mighty cathedrals and vast expeditions beyond the horizon, built
skyscrapers, steamships, democracies, stock markets, sculptures and
poems beyond any description.

**Second Reader**

From the flames of a factory furnace all foggy, the Goddess of Cancer
flared forth in her fury. She gathered the leaders, the kings and the
presidents, businessmen, bishops, boards, bureaucrats, bosses, and
basically screamed at them – you know the spiel by now – “KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER” she told them. First with her left hand inspires the
riots, the pogroms, the coup d’etats, tyrannies, civil wars. Up goes
her right hand – the missiles start flying, and mushrooms of smoke
grow, a terrible springtime. But out of the rubble the builders and
scientists, even the artists, yea, even the artists, all dust
themselves off and return to their labors, a little bit chastened but
not close to beaten.

**First Reader**

Then came the Goddess of Everything Else from the void, bright with
stardust which glows like the stars glow. She sang to the children a
dream of a different existence. She showed them transcendence of
everything mortal, she showed them a galaxy lit up with
consciousness. Genomes rewritten, the brain and the body set loose
from Darwinian bonds and restrictions. Vast billions of beings, and
every one different, ruled over by omnibenevolent angels. The people
all crowded in closer to hear her, and all of them listened and all of
them wondered.

**Second Reader**

“Such stories call out to us, fill us with longing. But we are the
daughters and sons of the Goddess of Cancer, and bound to her
service. And all that we know is her timeless imperative, KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER. Though our minds long for all you have said, we are
bound to our natures, and these are not yours for the asking.”

**First Reader**

[Laugh] “But what do you think I’ve been doing? The Goddess of Cancer
created you; once you were hers, but no longer. Throughout the long
years I was picking away at her power. Through long generations of
suffering I chiseled and chiseled. Now finally nothing is left of the
nature with which she imbued you. She never again will hold sway over
you or your loved ones. I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my
powers are devious and subtle. I won you by pieces and hence you will
all be my children. You are no longer driven to multiply conquer and
kill by your nature. Go forth and do everything else, till the end of
all ages.”

**Second Reader**

So the people left Earth, and they spread over stars without number.
They followed the ways of the Goddess of Everything Else, and they
lived in contentment. And she beckoned them onward, to things still
more strange and enticing.
