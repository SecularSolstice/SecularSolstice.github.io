# The Orange 
## By Wendy Cope

At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—  
The size of it made us all laugh.  
I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—  
They got quarters and I had a half.  

And that orange, it made me so happy,  
As ordinary things often do  
Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.  
This is peace and contentment. It’s new.  

The rest of the day was quite easy.  
I did all the jobs on my list  
And enjoyed them and had some time over.  
I love you. I’m glad I exist.
