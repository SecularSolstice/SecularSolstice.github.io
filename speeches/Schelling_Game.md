# Schelling Game
## By Rivka Fleischman & Maia Werbos

This is a game about coordination, to be played before the main ritual as an icebreaker.

Estimate your number of attendees and your desired average group size-- e.g. if you expect 40 attendees, and want groups of 4 on average, select 10 categories.

Pass out handouts with each category and ask attendees to take a randomly selected one as they come in.

Their task is to find other attendees with the same category, then each person tries to think of an item in the category they expect the others will also pick. They reveal their choices at the same time to see if they succeeded.

Optional: at the start of the ritual, ask attendees to share their experience in their group.
