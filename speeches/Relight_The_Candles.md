# Relight the Candles
## By Matt Elder

And now, we’ll light our candles again. Some large tapers will start in the front row. When these reach you, light your own candle; ensure that your neighbors’ candles are lit, and pass the taper to someone behind you. Take care with the open flames; don’t feel rushed.


This will take a few minutes.


As we light these flames, you might pay attention to the wave of fire and light sweeping across the space. You might pay attention to your friends and neighbors -- and comfort them, or hold them, or just be gently present with them. You might even gaze into each other’s faces.


You might choose to notice that this other person contains an entire world of experience, as complex as your own. They have their own history, their own stories and dreams; they have their own awareness of the world. Behind their eyes is a vastness.


You might continue to notice that, each little flame being lit in this room is held by the hand of a mind attached to an awareness, vast, and deep, and precious. 


And if none of that feels right just now, you might just sit in quiet contemplation.


But do help to make sure that everyone’s flame is lit.
