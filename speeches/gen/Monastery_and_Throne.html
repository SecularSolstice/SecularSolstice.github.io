Jacob Falkovich, adapted as a speech by Daniel Speyer</h2>
<p><em>(Original blog post is <a
href="https://putanumonit.com/2021/04/03/monastery-and-throne/">here</a>)</em></p>
<p>On March 20th, Dominic Cummings, chief of staff for the British
Government, tweeted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your Seeing Smoke blog. It and ScottA on 2 March helped me
and some others in no. 10 realize we were going terribly wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Your” in this tweet referenced Jacob Falkovich. “ScottA” to Scott
Alexander (Aaronson didn’t post about covid on the second of March).</p>
<p>Jacob wrote that his first thoughts in response to this were: holy
shit! His second: if I had known you will read it, I would have written
a better post!</p>
<p>A less immediate response was: The four hours I spent writing Seeing
the Smoke on a whim were more impactful than projects I spent months of
my life on.</p>
<p>That’s how it is sometimes. Fortune favors the prepared, but it’s
still fortune: fickle and unpredictable.</p>
<p>And we might ask: why was this necessary? The UK has a public health
office, much like the US CDC. Back to Jacob:</p>
<p>Social reality is what is normal, accepted, cool, predictable,
expected, rewarded, agreed upon. Physical reality is what is out there
determining the outcomes of physical experiments, such as whether you
get COVID or not if you wear a mask.</p>
<p>My best guess of the typical experience is being in social reality
99.9% of the time. The 0.1% are extreme shocks, cases when physical
reality kicks someone so far off-script they are forced to confront it
directly. These experiences are extremely unpleasant. One looks for the
first opportunity to dive back into the safety of social reality, in the
form of a communal narrative that “makes sense” of what happened and
suggests an appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>I think this explains why so many people don’t seem to notice or care
that even institutions they consider to be “on their side”, like the
CDC, are wrong or lying all the time. People look to those sources not
for “truth” about physical reality but for coordination of social
reality. The CDC’s job is to tell other institutions which policies they
can implement and not get blamed for, not which policies will keep their
clients healthy.</p>
<p>Seeing the Smoke came out during the 0.1% of the time when physical
reality was manifesting and the institutions of social reality hadn’t
reacted adequately yet by spinning it into the narrative.</p>
<p>I think that Rationality gives people two important things: the tools
to evaluate original thinkers without relying on mere credentials, and
the permission to occasionally shoot for physical-reality-based insight
themselves.</p>
<p>Byrne Hobart in a post about how Rationalists got COVID right and
early, writes:</p>
<p>[yes, I’m quoting Jacob quoting Byrne]</p>
<p>This puts the rationalists in a uniquely prosocial position. They’re
a sort of distributed, mostly open-source monastic order, spending a lot
of time contemplating the world and passing down important observations,
but less time directly interacting with it. The influence of people who
read rationalist blogs, but don’t self-identify as rationalists, is
quite wide.</p>
<p>Byrne goes on to say that “identifying as a Rationalist is a losing
move”, but I think that he presupposes that everyone is playing the same
game. Joining a monastic order is a “losing move” if your goal is to
inherit titles and command knights, but the life of a monk has much to
recommend it over the life of the medieval court and battlefield.</p>
<p>I identify as a Rationalist so that I am held to the high standards
of epistemology and ethics of our monastic order. It’s an identity that,
on the margin, nudges me slightly away from the pursuit of power and
toward the pursuit of wisdom. In the long run it’s the better pursuit.
Rationality has a long game.</p>
<p>This concludes the quoting-Jacob part of the speech, for those of you
keeping track.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of flexibility in the rationality community. High
standards of epistemology are pretty core, but identity, purpose,
strategy and time discounting all vary freely from person to person.</p>
<p>So I read all this not to say that we should all become Jacob – that
would be kind of awesome, but a net loss with, you know, the diversity –
but to point at how we do have a place in the here and now… and a
perspective for the next five thousand years.</p>
