<h1 id="natural-questions">Natural Questions</h1>
<h2 id="by-seneca">By Seneca</h2>
<p>The time will come when diligent research over long periods will
bring to light things which now lie hidden.<br />
A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be
enough for the investigation of so vast a subject…<br />
And so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive
ages.<br />
There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did
not know things that are so plain to them…<br />
Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us
will have been effaced.<br />
Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for
every age to investigate…<br />
Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all.</p>
<p>— Seneca, Natural Questions, Book 7, first century. From Carl Sagan’s
Comos (how the book starts) [make sure to say it’s a quote from the
first century AD]</p>
