<h2 id="by-cody-wild">By Cody Wild</h2>
<p>There are some emotions that it feels like our society has reasonable
scripts for dealing with. But, in my experience, grief has never really
among them, particularly for those of us who don’t believe in any
divinity or afterlife. We come back to the same canned platitudes, like
“I’m sorry for your loss” because so much of what lies outside of those
safe, rote lines feels in danger of slipping off one side of a
knife-edge.</p>
<p>It seems unspeakably cruel to reinforce someone’s sense of despair,
to tell them that their darkest voices are right. But positivity and
optimism feel false, even insulting: hope we have no right to give.
Sadness and anger at least have their roots in the world that still is.
Grief is the acute awareness of an absence, something or someone ripped
from the fabric of your life. Grief can destabilize; can feel like
trying to learn how to walk after an amputation. With every step your
muscle memory tries to lean back into the limb that isn’t there, and you
wobble on, trying to find some new balance.</p>
<p>You can’t tell someone that an absence will be filled again, because
it probably won’t be, not perfectly. There will always be nooks and
crannies that stay empty, even with our best efforts. We can’t say that
it will eventually get better. Broken things don’t always get rebuilt,
and things we lose sometimes just… stay lost.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, a good friend of mine died suddenly. I was far
from the hardest hit by their death, but it did give me a painfully
close encounter with grief. When I heard about their death, it felt like
the universe had suddenly shuddered into an unthinkable, incoherent
trajectory. The parts of my life that entwined around them were
unquestioned solidity one minute, and utterly gone the next.</p>
<p>This year, I think many of us have become acquainted with a broader
palette of grief and loss than we ever thought we would have to
experience. Grief for human life is horrifying, and wrenching, and
intense, and one of the worst feelings we have to endure. But on some
basic level it’s something I expected I would have to face someday, part
of the biological contract with mortality. Growing up, I never
considered what it would feel like to feel grief for normality itself.
To an even greater extent than the more typical forms of grief, it’s
something that feels hard to talk about with the weight and nuance it
deserves.</p>
<p>This is grief that we have even less of a language for.</p>
<p>This year, so many parts of my life, big and small, have turned into
aching absences. I imagine the same is true for many of you.</p>
<p>Late night conversations at crowded parties, leaning your head on a
friend’s shoulder without thinking. The uncomplicated certainty of
knowing you’ll visit your family at the holidays. The tingling
excitement of stepping onto an airplane going someplace new, without
having to worry how tightly your mask is fitting. Social institutions
you’ve invested in and cared deeply about that simply can’t translate to
the digital. Communities that used to be full of warmth and dynamism,
now ghostly remnants trying to subsist on the forms of connection that
remain.</p>
<p>When I look at my own life, it can be hard to even account for all
the things I’ve lost, since, some days, it feels like my world is filled
up more by the empty spaces left behind than by the handful of things
I’ve managed to cling to.</p>
<p>It’s probably the case that we’ve not lost all of these things
permanently. But we don’t really know yet what the world will look like
after this.</p>
<p>This is loss, and what I felt for all those little experiences of
normality was grief, but it took me a while to acknowledge that to
myself. It felt stupid and insignificant to put the loss I felt for
these small joys and wonders in the same category as the loss of human
life. Who was I to claim to be grieving, I asked myself. I hadn’t even
known anyone who had died in the pandemic. They were the only ones who
had the right to that emotion.</p>
<p>But there is not some fixed pool of grief in the world, that my
taking the emotional frame robs it from someone who needs it more. In my
non-theological view of things, there are no spirits to be offended by
the comparison, no dead we are dishonoring… there are just people,
trying to put their worlds back together. Grief is for the living. And
all can mourn our different forms of brokenness together, without that
implying a claim that our losses are equal.</p>
<p>Telling ourselves that what we lost was trivial in some cosmic,
objective sense is just unnecessary cruelty, when we know it wasn’t
trivial for us.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;</p>
<p>For me, the hardest part of processing my grief for the world as it
was before this year has been convincing myself to remember how things
were… but not to be consumed by that remembering. It can be hard for me
to choose to conjure up the bright colors of the past, when I know that
doing so will make the pain of returning to the muted, grey affordances
of today even more stark.</p>
<p>It’s easier to just forget what “community” really felt like. What
“excitement” felt like. What “optimism” felt like. Because the less I
remember them, the less I’ll have to feel the weight of their absence,
the massive outlines in my life where they used to be. The less I’ll be
overwhelmed into paralysis by the magnitude of the loss. It’s really,
really tempting to shut all that out.</p>
<p>But I worry that, if I do shut it out, I’ll curl myself up too small
to fit what’s left, and become too used to only inhabiting the smallness
of the present world. That when the world opens up, and there’s room for
good things to grow again, I’ll have lost the muscle memory I would need
to inhabit the spaciousness of that possibility, to fill the newfound
space with ambitious and valuable and lovely things. To plant seeds in a
garden I may not get to see grow to be as strong as it was before the
world broke. And, at least for me, I think rebuilding will mean somehow
keeping my memories of the good things alive and real-feeling long
enough for them to give me a blueprint for the institutions and
connections and investments I’ll want to be able to bring back into the
world someday. Even though it hurts to go back to grey after remembering
a world of color.</p>
<p>If it’s right for you, take 15 seconds now to really remember what
some of the good things that this year has taken away felt like.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our obligation is to the future. Sometimes, fulfilling
that obligation means stoking a fire higher, giving it fuel to light the
night. But, sometimes, it means finding a few embers amidst the ashes,
and keeping them safe until they can light a new batch of kindling. Even
if the embers won’t be enough to really keep you warm, and in the
meantime all you’ll have is the memory of fire.</p>
