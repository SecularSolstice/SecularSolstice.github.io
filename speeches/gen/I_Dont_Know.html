<h1 id="i-dont-know">I Don’t Know</h1>
<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>The virtue of darkness is to face reality at its harshest without
looking away.</p>
<p>There are many forms of darkness, but perhaps the most primal is to
not know things.</p>
<p>Humans crave certainty.</p>
<p>Is there a lion lurking in the shadows or not? Will your family
abandon you or not? Will your parents or government or God somehow make
sure that everything will ultimately be okay?</p>
<p>And sometimes the answer is no, you’re on your own and that’s
awful.</p>
<p>But… at least you know where you stand.</p>
<p>Sometimes though the answer is just “I don’t know”.</p>
<p>And you have to make a decision and take action without knowing. And
you might have to make trade-offs or sacrifices. And you won’t find out
tomorrow or next week or even a year from now whether those sacrifices
were worth it.</p>
<p>This year there were a lot of things I didn’t know.</p>
<p>Some of them were concrete and easy to think about. How easily does
COVID spread? How likely am I to die or suffer long-term debilitating
effects? Do masks work? What distances can we safely see each other
outdoors?</p>
<p>Back in April the answer to most of these was “we don’t know yet”.
And we had to make calls about what to do, regardless, and nine months
later some of the answers still aren’t quite as clear as I would
like.</p>
<p>But those were the straightforward questions.</p>
<p>Some questions got murkier, questions about what other people
believe, questions about game theory and moral uncertainty and how to
handle scarcity.</p>
<p>And I didn’t know the answers, and I didn’t know what other people
thought the answers were.</p>
<p>How dangerous do other people think that COVID is? What norms do they
think there should be in a pandemic and how do they think we should
enforce those norms?</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p>What crumbling pillars of my life do I need to survive? Which pillars
do my loved ones need?</p>
<p>If my spouse or housemate or friends or coworkers disagree about how
to coordinate, what happens?</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p>How do I feel about that?</p>
<p>I’m not sure.</p>
<p>If I say “screw it, I’m sick of living in fear, I’m just going to
live my life normally”, how likely am I to give COVID to someone
else?</p>
<p>If I decide “screw it, I’m sick of negotiating with everyone, I’m
running away to the woods”, what pieces of infrastructure will crumble a
little bit in my absence?</p>
<p>Which friends needed me?</p>
<p>How many other people will run away into the woods, and what will we
leave behind?</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p>If I’m overwhelmed and alone and don’t have the skills to do the
right thing, which mistakes can I get away with making?</p>
<p>If a friend is overwhelmed and alone and they hurt me, how do I feel
about that?</p>
<p>If I hurt a friend because I thought carefully and soberly through
the trade-offs and wrung my hands, but ultimately decided they were on
the wrong side of a trolley problem, how do I feel about that?</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p>It’s the end of the year, and here we are.</p>
<p>And it’s a reasonable time to want to make sense of things, to put
the year in perspective, to ask “which sacrifices were worth it”?</p>
<p>And it’s a reasonable time to want to remind ourselves that we’re all
on the same team and put the year behind us.</p>
<p>And ultimately I do think we’re all on the same team, and I have
guesses about which sacrifices were worth it and which were not, but the
fact is I’m not nearly confident about any of that to justify giving it
in a Solstice speech.</p>
<p>And it’s a complicated question to ask,</p>
<p>what does it mean for us to all be on the same team if we have
different needs and values and beliefs about what the right thing to do
is?</p>
<p>I hurt people this year.</p>
<p>And I don’t know yet, which of those were mistakes and which of them
were the least bad choice I could find at the time, and which of them
were actually just the right decision, and I’m sorry.</p>
<p>I know other people who hurt each other, and who were quietly
abandoned.</p>
<p>And the question looms, how do we make sense of all of that and find
meaning, and be a community, and I wanted to have an answer for you guys
tonight and I thought about it really hard and I tried.</p>
<p>But I don’t know</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>This isn’t a tribe about getting to confidently know things
together.</p>
<p>This is a tribe about figuring things out.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to walk through the darkness a while. Neither
entirely alone, but not entirely together.</p>
<p>With miles to go before morning.</p>
