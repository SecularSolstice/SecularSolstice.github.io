<h1 id="prediction-wwii">Prediction: WWII</h1>
<p>In 1918, economist Silvio Gesell wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In spite of the holy promises of people to banish war once and for all, … I dare to predict today that it will take less than twenty-five years until we have a new and even worse war. … Increasing numbers of unemployed persons will roam the streets. … Within these discontented masses, wild, revolutionary ideas will arise and with it also the poisonous plant called ‘Super Nationalism’ will proliferate. No country will understand the other, and the end can only be war again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was utterly, horrifyingly correct.</p>
