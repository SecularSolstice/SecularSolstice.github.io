<h1 id="prediction-wwii">Prediction: WWII</h1>
<p>In 1918, economist Silvio Gesell wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In spite of the holy promises of people to banish war once and for
all, … I dare to predict today that it will take less than twenty-five
years until we have a new and even worse war. … Increasing numbers of
unemployed persons will roam the streets. … Within these discontented
masses, wild, revolutionary ideas will arise and with it also the
poisonous plant called ‘Super Nationalism’ will proliferate. No country
will understand the other, and the end can only be war again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was utterly, horrifyingly correct.</p>
