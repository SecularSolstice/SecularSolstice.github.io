<p>At Solstices, we like to tell the story of humanity’s past triumphs.
Today is Smallpox Eradication Day, the thirty-seventh anniversary of
when we certified its eradication. It’s an inspiring story. Little by
little, we pushed on the frontiers of our medical knowledge, from the
first experimental vaccines in the 18th century to better vaccines and
distribution and culminating in a massive organized push to wipe it out
entirely.</p>
<p>But this isn’t always what happens when you push on frontiers,
whether they’re frontiers of knowledge or of geography or of something
else.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you push on a frontier and the result simply doesn’t
stick.</p>
<p>In 1747, James Lind proved that citrus fruits were an effective cure
for scurvy. Ideally, that story would have been similar to the story of
smallpox: incremental improvements in knowledge culminating in the
elimination of a disease, or at least relegating it to obscure corners
of the world. That is how we think of knowledge as working; once a
discovery is made, and published, the intellectual frontier is pushed
back forever. But that didn’t happen in this case. Instead, the cure was
lost, and scurvy was a recurring problem for sailors in the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. In 1860 the British switched from giving
their sailors lemons to giving them limes, not having the language to
distinguish the two and not knowing that the lime juice they were using
lacked vitamin C. It wasn’t until 1932 that ascorbic acid - vitamin C -
was isolated and determined to be the thing that prevents scurvy. That
should have been the end of that. And yet, according to the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the vitamin C deficiency rate
in the United States is 13%, as measured by blood tests.^1</p>
<p>Sometimes frontiers stop being frontiers. In the 1980s, there was a
frontier called Usenet, where tech-savvy people would gather to discuss
things. But in the 90s, it opened up to everyone - the “eternal
September” - and it stopped being a frontier. In one sense, this was a
positive outcome; but for everyone who wanted to be on a frontier, it
was bad.</p>
<p>In 1969, we launched the Apollo 11 rocket to the moon. In principle,
that should have pushed back the frontier - to have made space a place
where it’s possible to go. But the successor to the Apollo rocket - the
Space Shuttle - was not well designed. It could not go to the moon, and
each launch was fantastically expensive. And so we gradually retreated
from space, and today, we have forgotten how to make Saturn Vs. Parts of
the design, and the tooling, have been lost.</p>
<p>This song is about that.</p>
