<h4 id="before-the-solstice">Before the Solstice</h4>
<p>Attendees at the solstice (either all or many) bring content to be
used, tagged with where in the arc it goes (light, twilight, night or
morning).</p>
<p>The organizer creates a preliminary schedule, talking to contributors
as needed.</p>
<h4 id="this-activity">This Activity</h4>
<p>Put the preliminary schedule into a form that’s easy to reorder. This
could be a Google Doc displayed via data projector or sticky notes along
a wall (write large and in sharpie).</p>
<p>When people bring last-minute content, insert it somewhere
appropriate. Don’t rethink the order from scratch. Even if this results
in a suboptimal total ordering, it’s not worth the time.</p>
<p>Then go over the entire proposed schedule with everyone and make sure
everybody’s ok with it. Make changes as needed.</p>
<p>Or, if there’s a general consensus that the room trusts you and
everybody wants to start, just go ahead with the schedule as is.</p>
