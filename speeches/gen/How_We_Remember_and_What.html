post</a>)</em></p>
<p>One hundred years ago, the greatest and most lethal natural disaster
of the twentieth century came for the U.S., alighting at Commonwealth
Pier in Boston.</p>
<p>By the time it had run its course, the Influenza Pandemic of 1918 –
the Spanish Flu – killed more than three percent of the human species.
It had infected about 500 million people world-wide, killing at least 50
million.</p>
<p>In the U.S., more than a quarter of the population contracted it, and
over a half a million people died – mostly in a span of about ten
weeks.</p>
<p>In 1918, the US – as was most of the rest of the world – was at war.
We had taken all our strapping young lads, handed them guns, and bunked
them in over-crowded camps. And then shuffled them around the world. Not
just us, of course. The militaries engaged in the European theater of
war – densely settled populations of healthy young men – proved the most
perfect vector for Spanish Flu imaginable.</p>
<p>Not that such a virulent plague needed our assistance to promulgate.
It ripped through the civilian population nearly as easily. By the end
of October, almost 4,000 people had died of it in Boston.</p>
<p>Not, mind you, in all Massachusetts. Not even in the greater Boston
area. That number doesn’t include the dead of Cambridge, or Newton, or
Chelsea, or Waltham, or any of the surrounding towns. Just Boston
proper. Nearly 4,000 people died in just the city of Boston in ten
weeks.</p>
<p>Something like ten times as many people had fallen ill with it in the
first place.</p>
<p>Multiply that across the entire state. Across the entire nation.</p>
<p>They closed the schools, they closed the theaters, they forbade
people to attend funerals, they ran out of hospital beds so they
converted empty schools to hospitals and they ran out of nurses so they
told the idle teachers that if they volunteered as medics they would
continue to be paid. They set up vast tent-city open-air hospitals just
to have somewhere to put all the sick and struggling to survive. They
ran out of coffins.</p>
<p>The stories are not hard to find if you chose to seek them out,
though they are perhaps harder to find than they should be. Perhaps
these are stories everyone who has passed through our public
pedagogical-propagandistic complex should have ready on their tongues.
If only to know it was a great and grave matter. Surely the greatest
mass death in human history was at least as important as any stupid
Archduke.</p>
<p>So why isn’t it recognized as such?</p>
<p>A hypothesis:</p>
<p>There is a faction of people, and in the US it has been estimated to
be about a third of the population, which is past-oriented: they cherish
tradition, quite simply because it is tradition, and see the value in
what is old, tried-and-tested, enduring. They tend to mistrust change,
and social change most of all.</p>
<p>They are who in our society is concerned with commemoration. It is
they who lower the flags and arrange the parades, they who tend the
graves and erect the monuments. It is they who teach the children the
songs and have them sing them on the appointed days. It is they who are
concerned with remembering what should not be forgot, not just as story
that is told but in ceremony that is performed.</p>
<p>And there’s a different faction, non-overlapping with the former,
that is future-oriented: they are neophilic, intellectually restless,
and curious. They even are given to priding themselves in overturning
what is old to make way for the new and presumed better. They admire
iconoclasts. And it is, to an extent wildly disproportionate to their
estimated prevalence in the population, from their ranks that our
population of scientists are drawn.</p>
<p>And when I say “they”, here, I mean “we”. Certainly me, and very many
of you hearing this.</p>
<p>We future-oriented inventors and discoverers and tinkerers and
hackers, we have our technologies: digital and biochemical and all the
rest. The past-oriented have their technologies, too; their customs and
ceremonies are social technologies. They transmit social values – ideas
of what their society collectively considers good and bad – forward
through time, to successive generations, so they are not lost to society
and society may endure.</p>
<p>And that is what I mean when I say: our society does not remember the
Influenza Pandemic of 1918. Yes, the information is available in books,
in documentaries, in archives, on web pages, in the knowledge of
scholars. But those are an inert, latent form of knowledge, that has
little influence on society.</p>
<p>How should any society that has befall it something like the Spanish
Flu yet not commemorate it in the solemn way such a grave and ghastly
matter deserves, how would it not have anti-vaxxers? How would it fund
basic research? How would it ever treat future natural disasters as
things worthy of preparing for, preventing, redressing, or remediating,
on a societal scale?</p>
<p>This is the gap that must be bridged, that between the
future-oriented who would – do! – lay wonders of biomedical invention at
the feet of society and the past-oriented who choose what values are
propagated by commemoration of the past to future generations.</p>
<p>Strangely, then, part of the solution is that we in the
future-oriented faction must realize the enormous value of the
past-oriented’s memetic technology, and stop scorning it; and must
elicit their cooperation and assistance in commemorating what is
important to us – what we realize is important to be remembered.</p>
<p>And, of course, another part of the solution is that we in the
future-oriented faction must realize just what it is that is important
to be remembered.</p>
