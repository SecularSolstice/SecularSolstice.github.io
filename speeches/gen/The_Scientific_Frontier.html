Frontier / Truth and Beauty</h1>

<p>[Context: this was for a Solstice themed around physical and
intellectual frontiers that humanity has faced; this speech addresses
the scientific frontier.]</p>
<p>[Editor’s Note: I am somewhat confused as to the actual title of this
piece]</p>
<p>I grew up as an atheist surrounded by a Christian family, and reading
Dawkins as a teenager was my first exposure to secular worldviews
independent of my own. My best friend, in high school, gave me copies of
The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene, and I remember sneaking them into
my backpack and reading at home under my covers. Life is much better now
that I’ve got a community of other secular people with whom to share
ideas, but I’m still pretty fond of those formational memories. I want
to share with you all some stories I learned from one of Dawkins’ books,
Unweaving the Rainbow.</p>
<p>The title Unweaving the Rainbow comes from a poem by Keats, in which
Keats complains about Newton’s discovery that light splits into a
spectrum. Here’s Keats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not all charms fly<br />
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?<br />
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:<br />
We know her woof, her texture; she is given<br />
In the dull catalogue of common things.<br />
Philósophy will clíp an Angel’s wings,<br />
Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,<br />
Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine—<br />
Unweave a rainbow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keats did not appreciate scientists going around and ruining the
mysterious; he prefers the state of ignorance, thinking it to be
aesthetically prettier. In fact, Keats turned this whole notion into a
philosophy, saying for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What quality [goes] to form a Man of Achievement in Literature &amp;
which Shakespeare possessed so enormously [is] “Negative Capability,”
that is when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries,
doubts, without any “irritable” reaching after fact &amp; reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t suspect Keats’ position would be popular among this
community. I’ll let Richard Feynman handle this one for us. Keats
complains about the “mere” touch of cold philosophy, but Feynman
responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is “mere.” Poets say science takes away from the beauty of
the stars— “mere” globs of gas atoms. I too can see the stars on a
desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of
the heavens stretches my imagination – stuck on this carousel my little
eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern—of which I am a
part—perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star. What is the
pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery
to know a little about it! For far more marvelous is the truth than any
artists of the past imagined. Why do the poets of the present not speak
of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a
man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must
be silent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On another occasion, Feynman says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The beauty that is there for the poet is also available for the
scientist, too. But the scientist sees a deeper beauty that isn’t so
readily available to others. The complicated interactions of the flower.
The color of the flower is red. Does the fact that the plant has color
mean that it evolved to attract insects? This adds a further question.
Can insects see color? Do insects have an aesthetic sense? And so on. I
don’t see how studying a flower ever detracts from its beauty. It only
adds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I’m not here to wax poetic about why science is beautiful, much
though I enjoy quoting Feynman. Blindly revering science is just as bad
as blindly revering the mysterious. The reason why humans have been
exploring the <strong>scientific frontier</strong> throughout our
history, the <strong>reason why we study science</strong>, is because
science is <strong>useful</strong>.</p>
<p>Even that simple discovery by Newton, the splitting of light, was
useful. Here’s one thing that came of it. In 1814, the German physicist
Joseph von Fraunhofer discovered that there are certain dark features,
absorption lines, in the spectrum of sunlight. Later, others discovered
that these dark lines correspond exactly to absorption lines we observe
in the spectra of elements like hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Nowadays,
the position of these lines for each element are accurately predicted by
quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Before this discovery, we could have had no hope of rigorously
studying the chemical composition of faraway stars. In 1835, in fact,
one natural philosopher rashly wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We shall never be able to study, by any method, the stars’ chemical
composition or their mineralogical structure. Our positive knowledge of
stars is necessarily limited to their geometric and mechanical
phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll conclude by quoting to you from Unweaving the Rainbow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, by meticulous analysis of Fraunhofer lines in starlight, we
know in great detail what the stars are made of. Modern instruments
spectacularly outperform Newton’s prism, but today’s science of
spectroscopy is the direct descendant of Newton’s unweaving of the
rainbow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can tell in great detail which chemical substances are present in
a star, as well as its temperature, pressure and size; thanks to other
techniques in astronomy, we can also detect features such as orbiting
planets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By unweaving starlight in spectroscopes we know that stars are
nuclear furnaces, fusing helium out of the hydrogen that dominates their
mass; then thrusting helium nuclei together in the further cascade of
impurities which make up most of the rest of the elements, forging the
medium-sized atoms of which we are eventually made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now invite everyone who is attending to come up to the altar and
light a candle. The candles represent the frontiers that we have
explored and the frontiers that are open to us to explore. While you
light candles we’ll be playing a video of footage from the International
Space Station, which is both a reminder of what humanity has
accomplished so far and a reminder of all that we haven’t accomplished
yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor ever yet<br />
The melting rainbow’s vernal-tinctur’d hues<br />
To me have shone so pleasing, as when first<br />
The hand of science pointed out the path<br />
In which the sun-beams gleaming from the west<br />
Fall on the wat’ry cloud, whose darksome veil<br />
Involves the orient, and that trickling show’r<br />
Piercing thro’ every crystalline convex<br />
Of clust’ring dew-drops to their flight oppos’d,<br />
Recoil at length where concave all behind<br />
Th’internal surface of each glassy orb<br />
Repells their forward passage into air;<br />
That thence direct they seek the radiant goal<br />
From which their course began; and as they strike<br />
In diff’rent lines the gazer’s obvious eye,<br />
Assume a diff’rent lustre, thro’ the brede<br />
Of colours changing from the splendid rose<br />
To the pale violet’s dejected hue.</p>
