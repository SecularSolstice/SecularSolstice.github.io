<p>Exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Make sure to know in advance what your cooking facilities are. Things
can be prepared elsewhere and brought if timing and temperature
allow.</p>
<p>You can expect your attendees to have widely varying skills and
confidence regarding cooking. Be prepared to give some people supporting
roles.</p>
<p>It is likely wise to have a central point of co-ordination and to do
some planning. This way, you don’t have five desserts and no main course
(unless, of course, you want that) or three dishes that need to be baked
at different temperatures at the same time in only one oven.</p>
<p>We don’t really have traditional solstice foods, though things
requiring long preparation or low-tech preservation have been
proposed.</p>
