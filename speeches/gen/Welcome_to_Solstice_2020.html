<p>Hey everyone, welcome to Secular Solstice 2020</p>
<p>It… has been one pretty intense year. And this is going to be a
pretty weird solstice.</p>
<p>And… on one hand man, it sucks a lot that we can’t all be here
together, in person, for real. But, part of me is kinda excited that in
some ways, we’re <em>more</em> altogether here than ever before. I know
there are people tuning in from Berkeley, New York City, Boston, New
Hampshire, Undisclosed Locations in the Woods.</p>
<p>We’ve put a… kinda ridiculous amount of effort into building custom
online tools to bring us as close together as we can manage. I’m excited
to be here with all of you.</p>
<p>Now some of you might be thinking “I’ve been to 10 Solstice
celebrations and this one’s all weird and different and it’s in a little
rectangle and I’m confused. What’s going to happen exactly here.” And
others might be thinking “man, I’ve never been to a Solstice in my life
and this year it was just so convenient I finally showed up, but also,
um, yeah what exactly is going to happen here?”</p>
<p>Which are both quite reasonable questions, which we’ll answer in just
a second. But first, a little story about the reason for the season.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="speaker-b-laura">Speaker B (Laura)</h4>
<p>The Winter Solstice is the longest night of the year. It’s the
beginning of the return of the light. In a way it’s a kind of default
holiday for humanity. For ancient peoples, whether you were dealing with
literal ice and snow, or just a colder rainy season, it was important to
know <em>when the year would end.</em> And along the way, people had
stories talking about this. They shared stories of gods getting angry,
or about gods getting reborn. But no matter who you were, and what
stories you had, there was a question you were faced with – when would
winter come. And it <em>mattered</em> that you go beyond the stories,
that you go out into the world and <em>look</em>. There was a right
answer about when the darkness would come and when the light would
return. And knowing the right answer might determine whether your
community survived. Now, it’s not the literal astronomical solstice
today, we’re two days early. But we’re gathered here tonight to face the
coming darkness together. We’re here to celebrate the story of humanity,
and how our people brought light to the world.</p>
<p>As we do that, we’ll be undertaking a few different journeys
together.</p>
<p>We’ll be journeying from light, to darkness, into light again.<br />
We’ll be journeying from past, to present, to future. And hopefully,
we’ll be journeying from “a little bit uncomfortable singing out loud in
our living rooms” to “totally comfortable with that.” If you’re new, you
might not know most of the songs, but that’s okay. If you don’t think
you’re good at singing, that’s fine. Solstice is about singing together,
and even if you’ve never heard a song before we’d love to hear you
trying out singing along with it, and us, as best you can.</p>
<p>We have admins on the backend who will be fiddling with our
audio-settings in realtime to make sure we sound pretty nice together
and fix any crazy background noise that might suddenly come up. So no
matter where you are and whether you think of yourself as a singer,
tonight, please feel totally free to sing your heart out.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="speaker-c-alex">Speaker C (Alex)</h4>
<p>Now, what concretely is going to happen tonight?</p>
<p>First: This’ll be about two hours long. It’ll involve a lot of
singing, and a lot of listening to stories.</p>
<p>On the right side of the screen is a chat widget. For the first 30
minutes, that widget will be up, you can chat with each other about
what’s going on and catch up and just generally be virtual humans
together. But after 30 minutes, after we’ve settled in, that chat will
turn off. We’ll begin our descent into darkness, and try to get into a
ritual headspace.</p>
<p>As we descend into darkness, things may get uncomfortable. This
holiday is about facing difficult truths together, but it’s important to
protect yourself. If you’re not in a good headspace to reflect on how
awful reality can get, that’s okay. You can take a break and come back.
You can tap out, and come to the afterparty afterwards. We’ll also have
a corner at the afterparty for people who to help each other process
things.</p>
<p>Now: There’ll be people giving speeches. We care a lot about
not-saying-false-things at Solstice. We’ve put a <em>lot</em> of effort
into not-saying-false things. Nonetheless, the universe is a messy,
complicated place. We might not all believe the exact same things about
how the world is, or how to relate to it. If someone says something you
don’t agree with, that’s okay. Solstice is about collectively seeking
truth together. But it’s okay if we’re not all at the same page at the
same time.</p>
<p>Finally, on a logistical note – if you’ve got some candles, now is a
good time to light them. Over the course of the night, we’re going to
slowly turn off the lights. Maybe take note of where the lightswitch is
so you can do that more easily when the time comes.</p>

<p>And now, let’s get ready to sing, and journey through the past
together.</p>
