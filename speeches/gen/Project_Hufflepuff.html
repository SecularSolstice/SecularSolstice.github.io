<p>[Editor’s note: This is labeled Project Hufflepuff, but mostly draws
from Straw Hufflepuffs and Lone heroes.] For good or for ill, the
founding mythology of our community is a Harry Potter fanfiction. In J.K
Rowling’s original Harry Potter story, Hufflepuffs are treated like
“generic background characters” at best and as a joke at worst. All the
main characters are Gryffindors, courageous and true. All the bad guys
are Slytherin. And this is strange - Rowling clearly was setting out to
create a complex world with nuanced virtues and vices. But it almost
seems to me like Rowling’s story takes place in an alternate, explicitly
“Pro-Gryffindor propaganda” universe instead of the “real” Harry Potter
world. People have trouble taking Hufflepuff seriously, because they’ve
never actually seen the real thing - only lame, strawman caricatures.
Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is… well, Pro-Ravenclaw
propaganda. But part of being Ravenclaw is trying to understand things,
and to use that knowledge. Eliezer makes an earnest effort to steelman
each house. What wisdom does it offer that actually makes sense? What
virtues does it cultivate that are rare and valuable? When Harry goes
under the sorting hat, it actually tries to convince him not to go into
Ravenclaw, and specifically pushes towards Hufflepuff House. In the end,
Harry chooses to go to Ravenclaw - the obvious house, the place that
seemed most straightforward and comfortable. And ultimately… a hundred+
chapters later, I think he’s still visibly lacking in the strengths that
Hufflepuff might have helped him develop. He does work hard and is
incredibly loyal to his friends… but he operates in a fundamentally
lone-wolf mindset. He’s still manipulating people for their own good.
He’s still too caught up in his own cleverness. He never really has true
friends other than Hermione, and when she is unable to be his friend for
an extended period of time, it takes a huge toll on him that he doesn’t
have the support network to recover from in a healthy way. The story
does showcase Hufflepuff virtue. Hermione’s army is strong precisely
because people work hard, trust each other and help each other - not
just in big, dramatic gestures, but in small moments throughout the day.
But… none of that ends up really mattering. And in the end, Harry faces
his enemy alone. Lip service is paid to the concepts of friendship and
group coordination, but the dominant narrative is Godric Gryffindor’s
Nihil Supernum: <em>No rescuer hath the rescuer.</em> <em>No lord hath
the champion.</em> <em>No mother or father.</em> <em>Only nothingness
above.</em> The Sequences and HPMOR both talk about the importance of
groups, of emotions, of avoiding the biases that plague overly-clever
people in particular. But I feel like the communities descended from
Less Wrong, as a whole, are still basically that eleven-year-old Harry
Potter: abstractly understanding that these things are important, but
not really believing in them seriously enough to actually change their
plans and priorities. Here’s the thing. Yes, the world is horribly
unfair. It is full of poverty, and people trapped in demoralizing jobs.
It is full of stupid bureaucracies and corruption and people dying for
no good reason. It is full of beautiful things that could exist but
don’t. And there are terribly few people who are able and willing to do
the work needed to make a dent in reality. But as long as we’re willing
to look at monstrously unfair things and roll up our sleeves and get to
work anyway, consider this: It may be that one of the unfair things is
that one person can never be enough to solve these problems. That one of
the things we need to roll up our sleeves and do even though it seems
impossible is figure out how to coordinate and level up together and
rely on each other in a way that actually works. And maybe, while we’re
at it, find meaningful relationships that actually make us happy.
Because it’s not a coincidence that Hufflepuff is about both hard work
and warmth and camaraderie. The warmth is what makes the hard work
sustainable. Godric Gryffindor has a point, but Nihil Supernum feels
incomplete to me. There are no parents to step in and help us, but if we
look to our left, or right… <em>Yes, you are only one</em> <em>No, it is
not enough—</em> <em>But if you lift your eyes,</em> <em>I am your
brother</em> <em>-Vienna Teng</em></p>
