<h2 id="by-rivka-fleischman">by Rivka Fleischman</h2>
<p>There is a saying I was raised with. “If you save one person, it is
as if you’ve saved the entire world”. I think what my community meant by
it is that you may feel disheartened and give up because you cannot save
the world. But saving just one life is so meaningful, that even if
that’s all you can do, that’s enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree that one human life is of unimaginably high value. I also
hold that two human lives are twice as unimaginably valuable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-Eliezer Yudkowsky</p>
<p>As of today, globally, there have been 5 million, 280 thousand deaths
from coronavirus. 5 million, 280 thousand people we failed to save. 5
million, 280 thousand worlds we could have saved.</p>
<p>We know all this suffering and death is bad. But it’s hard for us to
visualize just how bad. We feel like it’s worse than one person dying.
But we don’t feel that it’s 5 million times worse. It’s hard for us to
conceptualize that much pain, suffering, and death.</p>
<p>It would take over 13 days to walk that many feet. That many seconds
would be more than 61 days. Approximately that many years ago humans
split off from other apes in the tree of evolution. That many miles is
approximately 22 times the distance between the earth and the moon.</p>
<p>Each of those 5 million, 280 thousand lives is one person whose life
was cut short. One person who had so much potential to do good. One
network of people whose lives with never be the same after they lost
someone they cared about. 5 million, 280 thousand lost lives that we
could have saved. That’s too many.</p>
<p>Those lives are gone; we’ve failed them. We cannot erase our
mistakes.</p>
<p>The monster that caused those deaths is not going anywhere. Covid
continues to mutate and grow. It will be here. Haunting and stalking us.
Wreaking havoc in its path. The world will never be the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re not playing for a “total victory” any more, we’ve already
missed our chance at a “perfect score.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a battle we’ve already lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A hundred billion people have already died.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rome fell. The barbarian hordes flooded through its gates. There were
a thousand years of darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve already missed our shot at a total victory. Now we’re just
building the best future we can.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So don’t get paralyzed looking for the right thing to do. Just find
the best action you can find, and do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-Nate Soares</p>
<p>So now, remembering the lives we’ve lost and the people we’ve failed,
we move forward. We accept our mistakes and we find the best route
forward. The route that does the most good going forward.</p>
<p>But tonight, we sit with the lives we’ve lost and the future we’ve
lost, and we mourn. Tonight, we grieve for the world we do not have.</p>
