<h1 id="the-story-of-winter">The Story of Winter</h1>
<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>The Winter Solstice is the longest night of the year. It ushers in a
time of cold and darkness.</p>
<p>For young civilizations, it was a time when if you <em>hadn’t</em>
spent the year preparing adequately for the future, then before spring
returned, you would run out of food and die. If you hadn’t striven to
use your tribe’s collective wisdom, to work hard beyond what was
necessary for immediate gratification… if you hadn’t harnessed the
physical and mental tools that humans have but that few other animals
do… then the universe, unflinchingly neutral, would destroy you without
a thought. And even if you did do these things, it might kill you
anyway. Fairness is not built into the equations of the cosmos.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the threat of death that inspired the first winter
holidays. It was that sense of unfairness, coupled with the desperate
hope that world couldn’t really be that unfair. It wouldn’t have
occurred to the first squirrels that stored food for winter, but it
gradually dawned upon ancient hominids, as their capacity for abstract
reasoning developed, alongside their desire to throw parties.</p>
<p>Our tendency is to anthropomorphize. Today, we angrily yell at our
cars and computers when they fail us. Rationally we know they are
unthinking hulks of metal, but we still ascribe malevolence when the
real culprit is a broken, unsentient machine.</p>
<p>There are plausible reasons for humans to have evolved this trait.
One of the most complicated tasks a human has to do is predict the
actions of other humans. We need to be able to make allies, to identify
deceptive enemies, to please lovers. I’m not an evolutionary
psychologist and I should be careful when telling this sort of Just-So
story, but I can easily imagine selection pressures that resulted in a
powerful ability to draw conclusions about sentient creatures similar to
ourselves.</p>
<p>And then, there was NOT a whole lot of pressure to NOT use this tool
to predict, say, the weather. Many natural forces are just too complex
for humans to be good at predicting. The rain would come, or it
wouldn’t, regardless of whether we ascribed it to gods or “emergent
complexity.” So we told stories about gods, with human motivations, and
we honestly believed them because there was nothing better.</p>
<p>And then, we had the solstice.</p>
<p>The world was dark and cold. The sun was retreating, leaving us only
with the pale moon and stars that lay unimaginably far away. There was
the encroaching threat of death, and just as powerfully, there was the
threat that sentient cosmic forces that held supreme power over our
world were turning their backs on us. And the best we could hope for was
to throw a celebration in their honor and pray that they wouldn’t be
angry forever, that the sun would return and the world would be
reborn.</p>
<p>And regardless, take a moment to be glad for having worked hard the
previous year, so that we had meat stored up and wine that had finished
fermenting.</p>
<p>But as ages passed, people noticed something interesting: there was a
pattern to the gods getting angry. Weather may be complex and
nigh-unpredictable. But the movements of the heavens… they follow rules
simple enough for human minds to understand, if only you take the time
to look.</p>
<p>We had a question. “When will the sun retreat, and when will it
return?”</p>
<p>When you really care about knowing the answer, you can’t make
something up. When you need to plan your harvest and prepare for winter
so that your family doesn’t starve, you can’t just say “Oh, God will
stop getting angry in a few months.”</p>
<p>If you want real knowledge, that you can apply to make your world
better…</p>
<p>Then you need to do science. Astronomy was born.</p>
<p>I want to give you some perspective on how much we cared about this.
Stonehenge is an ancient archaeological wonder. To the best of our
knowledge, it began as a burial site around 3000 BCE. Over the next
thousand years, it was gradually built, in major phases of activity
every few hundred years. Between 2600 and 2400 BCE, there was a surge of
construction. Huge stones were carted over huge distances, to create a
monument that’s lasted five thousand years.</p>
<p>30 sarsen stones. Each of them was at least 25 tons. They were
carried 25 miles.</p>
<p>80 bluestones. Four tons each. Carried over 150 miles.</p>
<p>In this era, the height of locomotive technology was “throw it on a
pile of logs and roll it.”</p>
<p>We don’t know exactly how they did all this. We don’t know all the
reasons why. But we know at least one: The megaliths at Stonehenge are
arranged, very specifically, to predict the Solstice – to the moment of
sunset.</p>
<p>30 stones, each 25 tons, carried over 25 miles. 80 stones, each four
tons, each carried over 150 miles.</p>
<p>200 years of that.</p>
<p>That’s how much we cared about the answer to our first astronomy
question.</p>
