<h1 id="worlds-that-never-were">Worlds That Never Were</h1>
<h2 id="by-claire-wang">by Claire Wang</h2>
<p>There are lots of people on the Internet and on TV every day telling
you how the world is going to dissolve into chaos at any moment. When
you think about all the people and animals needlessly suffering, it’s
easy to think that the world is terrible. When you read the news, or
look at the current state of the art in preparedness for global
catastrophic risks, it’s easy to think that the world is doomed, and
feel hopeless. But that’s why we’re here. We are here – in this
community and in this planetarium – because we believe that there is a
future worth fighting for.</p>
<p>What does that future look like? That’s hard to say. You know how
sometimes, when you look directly at a star in the night sky, it fades
so that you can barely see it, but when you look a little to the side
it’s bright again? That’s sort of how I feel about imagining the future.
It’s slippery, hard to get a grasp on, sort of just out of reach. But
for now, let’s try to picture it.</p>
<p>Imagine the world a few hundred years from now. Humanity has
completed a process of great deliberation. We’ve overcome global
coordination problems, so there’s no more poverty and no more war, and
existential risks have shrunk to a millionth of a millionth of their
current size. We have overcome physics and engineering challenges and
have ships on their way to the distant reaches of the galaxy. We have
overcome our biological limitations and no longer die so easily of
disease or accident or old age.</p>
<p>If we sit with that, it still feels abstract, and far away. So try to
imagine yourself in that future, even if how we imagine it today will
never be how it really is.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re with your family on a spaceship, off to colonize the
edge of the galaxy. Your faces are pressed to the window as you watch
the Earth grow small against the blackness. Though you’re leaving this
planet behind, probes have been sent out to terraform the barren rocks
that lie ahead, and they’ll be lush with life when you arrive. When the
pale blue dot has faded to nothing in the distance, you turn away from
the window and get to work preparing for the long journey ahead. Your
children call up to you and you answer with confidence. You’re in this
together. You believe you will make it to your destination. You are not
afraid.</p>
<p>Or maybe you’re there on the day the last factory farm closes.
Advances in lab-grown meat and our understanding of nutrition have
obviated the need for such cruelty, and our new ethical standards would
never allow it. You watch the animals stumble, confused, into the
daylight. It’s too late for most of them, but at least they are the
last. Humanity will never again commit torture like this.</p>
<p>Or maybe you work for the government, which is now a legible
institution whose mission feels like your mission. Every day you go to
work and uphold a system of laws that you believe in, and every night
you return home to your children, who are educated in a system that
actually lets them learn, while keeping their spirits bright and alive.
Around the dinner table at night, they debate with you about the ethics
of terraforming, tell you the history of the great deliberation, and
explain to you concepts in physics that you could never quite grasp.
Your bodies are warm, your stomachs are full, and your minds are active.
You’re free to pursue whatever you wish, without the constant nagging
guilt that you could be doing more to help others and prevent
extinction, because that’s all been taken care of.</p>
<p>The path ahead is full of obstacles. We don’t yet have the technology
to build space colonies or cheat old age, nor have we figured out what
incentives will end war, poverty, or factory farming for good. No matter
how hard we work, there’s always a chance we won’t make it to tomorrow.
But humanity has proved time and again that we can overcome forces of
nature once thought to be unstoppable, so no matter how slim the odds,
there’s also a chance that we’ll survive. And if we do, we should hold
onto those images of how good the future could be.</p>
<p>By and large, the people here tonight are not religious. We know that
we live in a world beyond the reach of God. If we are going to make it
out of this, it will have to be by our own power. If the future is going
to be as good as the stories I’ve told, we have to make it that way.
Now’s the time. Let’s make tomorrow beautiful.</p>
