<p>And now, we’ll light our candles again. Some large tapers will start
in the front row. When these reach you, light your own candle; ensure
that your neighbors’ candles are lit, and pass the taper to someone
behind you. Take care with the open flames; don’t feel rushed.</p>
<p>This will take a few minutes.</p>
<p>As we light these flames, you might pay attention to the wave of fire
and light sweeping across the space. You might pay attention to your
friends and neighbors – and comfort them, or hold them, or just be
gently present with them. You might even gaze into each other’s
faces.</p>
<p>You might choose to notice that this other person contains an entire
world of experience, as complex as your own. They have their own
history, their own stories and dreams; they have their own awareness of
the world. Behind their eyes is a vastness.</p>
<p>You might continue to notice that, each little flame being lit in
this room is held by the hand of a mind attached to an awareness, vast,
and deep, and precious. </p>
<p>And if none of that feels right just now, you might just sit in quiet
contemplation.</p>
<p>But do help to make sure that everyone’s flame is lit.</p>
