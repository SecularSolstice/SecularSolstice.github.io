<h2 id="by-jeffrey-ladish">By Jeffrey Ladish</h2>
<p>I wish I could see you all right now. But I’m just going to pretend
that you’re all out there somewhere, behind my computer.</p>
<p>A few years ago at Solstice I told the story of an old man who owned
a lodge at Mount Saint Helens. When the volcano was about to erupt,
threatening to destroy his lodge and whole life’s work, he couldn’t
bring himself to believe it. Despite some clear signs that the mountain
was about to blow, he wouldn’t leave, and he went down with his
cabin.</p>
<p>I hoped our community would be different. That when the signs pointed
to an impending disaster, we would notice and take action.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, there was an outbreak of a novel
coronavirus in Wuhan. A lot of major news outlets, like the Washington
Post, downplayed the risks. As late as the end of February they
confidently admonished those concerned, saying there was more to worry
about from the flu than this new virus.</p>
<p>We didn’t buy it. The new coronavirus was spreading in countries
around the world. And the death rate, while uncertain, looked
significantly higher than the flu. The unprecedented lockdown of the
entire province of Hubei, with over 50 million people, was another sign
that this time, things were different.</p>
<p>So we acted, we told our friends and families to buy food and toilet
paper, to be prepared for shortages. We went through the literature to
understand respiratory virus transmission dynamics. Shared information
on Lesswrong and in facebook groups. We designed quarantine protocols,
and thought about how to assess risk in this environment of
uncertainty.</p>
<p>When the CDC said there was no evidence that masks protected the
wearers from infection, we considered the Bayesian evidence of mask
effectiveness, and we bought n95s.</p>
<p>A thing I like about this community, it’s not just that people try to
figure out what’s true. It’s that they believe that true things can be
figured out. That while the world is complex and messy and often not
amenable to RCTs, we can still reduce our uncertainty.</p>
<p>The last year was significant to me, not just because it was weird
and bad and different. Not just because I worried for my friends and
family. This year is meaningful to me because it presents an opportunity
I’ve never had before.</p>
<p>To learn from an unfolding catastrophe. A global pandemic. The first
of its kind in my lifetime, and in my parents lifetimes, and my
grandparents lifetimes. And I don’t want to pass up the opportunity to
learn from something so significant, at such scales.</p>
<p>I want to know is how we did. You, me, the rationality community, our
health departments, our governments, our civilization. I want to know
what our predictions, our responses, our successes and our failures,
tell us about where we are, and where we need to improve to get where we
want to go.</p>
<p>I’m pretty happy that this community recognized the threat early on
and it took it seriously. Which isn’t to say we didn’t make any big
mistakes. I know I made some. But overall, I’m proud that we fought this
thing with our eyes open. That we didn’t blink when the storm hit.</p>
<p>I can’t quite say the same for our federal government. I think they
really fumbled the early response. In February, the CDC’s tests didn’t
work. The FDA wouldn’t let universities use the PCR tests they had
already developed. So we were blind to extent that the coronavirus was
spreading in our country.</p>
<p>A lot of mistakes were made. Coordination is hard. Risk assessment is
hard. Public health policy in a chaotic, polarized, aging bureaucracy is
hard.</p>
<p>But if I step back a little bit, and try to put this in perspective,
I think the world is handling this rather well.</p>
<p>It used to be, that a pandemic was the bizarre hand of a mad, angry
god. Now, a pandemic is the result of a virus, with a spike protein that
binds well with certain human cell receptors. And also, if we block
those receptors, by injecting some RNA into our bodies, and getting our
cells to produce some little bits that train our immune system to
produce other bits that prevent this virus, from binding to those cell
receptors, we can prevent infection.</p>
<p>And yes, we probably could have produced and tested a vaccine faster,
but the fact remains, that we have never produced and tested, so many
doses of a vaccine in such a short period of time. And it’s good that
we’ve come a long way, because we have a long way to go.</p>
<p>We beat smallpox because we learned how it worked, and how it could
be stopped. The story with Covid is the same, except that we learned
faster, and better.</p>
<p>I think that future challenges are going to be harder, maybe a lot
harder. Some of them aren’t going to give us good feedback. For some of
them, there will be no second chances at all.</p>
<p>So I say, let’s take the opportunity we have to learn from this year.
Let’s notice our mistakes and our confusions and the things we failed to
predict. Let’s be proud of each other for where we did well, where we
learned, where we grew.</p>
<p>I’m certainly proud of you all, not just for getting through this,
but for staying curious and keeping your eyes open.</p>
