<h1 id="the-goddess-of-everything-else-abridged">The Goddess of
Everything Else (Abridged)</h1>
<h2 id="by-scott-alexander">By Scott Alexander</h2>
<p><em>Adapted for two readers and liberally edited for length. The
first reader speaks the part of the Goddess of Everything Else, the
second the part of the Goddess of Cancer, and narration is divided
between them.</em></p>
<p><em>Note to the first reader: Most of your lines are (very loosely)
in verse! The pattern is unstressed-stressed-unstressed
unstressed-stressed-unstressed. It is meant to be sing-songy.</em></p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>Imagine two principles, here in poetic personification. The first is
the Goddess of Cancer, the second the Goddess of Everything Else. If
visual representations would help, you can think of the first with the
claws of a crab, and the second a dress made of feathers of
peacocks.</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>The Goddess of Cancer reached out a clawed hand over mudflats and
tidepools. She said pretty much what she always says, “KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER.” Then everything burst into life, became miniature
monsters engaged in a battle of all against all in their zeal to assuage
their insatiable longings. And the swamps became orgies of hunger and
fear and grew loud with the screams of a trillion amoebas.</p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>Then the Goddess of Everything Else trudged her way through the bog.
She stood on a rock and she sang them a dream of a different existence.
She showed them the beauty of flowers, the oak tree majestic, the roar
of the wind on the wings of the bird, and the swiftness and strength of
the tiger. She showed them the joy of the dolphins abreast of the waves
as the spray formed a rainbow around them, and all of them watched as
she sang and they all sighed with longing.</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>“Alas, what you show us is terribly lovely. But we are the daughters
and sons of the Goddess of Cancer, and wholly her creatures. The only
goals in us are KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER. And though our hearts
long for you, still we are not yours to have, and your words have no
power to move us. We wish it were otherwise, but it is not, and your
words have no power to move us.”</p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>“I scarcely can blame you for being the way you were made, when your
Maker so carefully yoked you. But I am the Goddess of Everything Else
and my powers are devious and subtle. So I do not ask you to swerve from
your monomaniacal focus on breeding and conquest. But what if I show you
a way that my words are aligned with the words of your Maker in spirit?
For I say unto you even multiplication itself when pursued with devotion
will lead to my service.”</p>
<p>As soon as she spoke it was so, and the single-celled creatures were
freed from their warfare. They joined hands in friendship, with this one
becoming an eye and with that one becoming a neuron. Together they
soared and took flight from the swamp and the muck that had birthed
them, and flew to new islands all balmy and green and just ripe for the
taking.</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>The Goddess of Cancer came forth from the fire and was not very
happy. The things she had raised from the mud and exhorted to kill and
compete had become all complacent in co-operation, a word which to her
was anathema. So she stretched out her right hand and spoke to the birds
and the beasts. And she said what she always says “KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY
CONQUER”, and so they all did, and they set on each other in violence
and hunger, their maws turning red with the blood of their victims,
whole species and genera driven to total extinction.</p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>Then came the Goddess of Everything Else from the waves like a siren,
all flush with the sheen of the ocean. She stood on a rock and she sang
them a dream of a different existence. She showed them the beehive all
golden with honey, the anthill all cozy and cool in the soil. She showed
them the pair-bond, the family, friendship. She showed these to
shorebirds and pools full of fishes, and all those who saw them, their
hearts broke with longing.</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>“Your music is lovely and pleasant, and all that you show us we
cannot but yearn for. But we are the daughters and sons of the Goddess
of Cancer, her slaves and creatures. And all that we know is the single
imperative KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER. Yes, once in the youth of the
world you compelled us, but now things are different, we’re all
individuals, no further change will the Goddess of Cancer allow us. So,
much as we love you, alas – we wish it were otherwise, but it is not,
and your words have no power to move us.”</p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>[Laugh] “But I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my powers are
devious and subtle. Return to your multiplication, but now having heard
me, each meal that you kill and each child that you sire will bind
yourself ever the more to my service.”</p>
<p>As soon as she spoke it was so, and the animals all joined together.
The wolves joined in packs, and in schools joined the fishes; the bees
had their beehives, the ants had their anthills, and even the termites
built big termite towers; the finches formed flocks and the magpies made
murders, the hippos in herds and the swift swarming swallows. And even
the humans put down their atlatls and formed little villages, loud with
the shouting of children.</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>The Goddess of Cancer came forth from the fire and saw things had
only grown worse in her absence. The lean, lovely winnowing born out of
pure competition and natural selection had somehow been softened. She
stretched out her left hand and snapped its cruel pincer, and said what
she always says: “KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER”. She said these things
not to the flocks or the tribes, but to each individual; many, on
hearing took food from the communal pile, or stole from the weak. Each
wolf at the throats of the others in hopes to be alpha, each lion
holding back during the hunt but partaking of meat that the others had
killed. And the pride and the pack seemed to groan with the strain, but
endured, for the works of the Goddess of Everything Else are not ever so
easily vanquished.</p>
<p>So the Goddess of Cancer now stretched out her right hand and spoke
to the flocks and the tribes, saying much she always says “KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER”. And upon one another they set, pitting black ant on
red ant, or chimps against gibbons, whole tribes turned to corpses in
terrible warfare. The stronger defeating the weaker, enslaving their
women and children, and adding them into their ranks.</p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>Then came the Goddess of Everything Else from the skies in a rainbow,
all coated in dewdrops. She sat on a menhir and spoke to the humans, and
all of the warriors and women and children all gathered around her to
hear as she sang them a dream of a different existence. She showed them
religion and science and music, she showed them the sculpture and art of
the ages. She showed them white parchment with flowing calligraphy,
pictures of flowers that wound through the margins. She showed them tall
cities of bright alabaster where no one went hungry or froze during the
winter. And all of the humans knelt prostrate before her, and knew they
would sing of this moment for long generations.</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>“Such things we have heard of in legends; if wishes were horses of
course we would ride them. But we are the daughters and sons of the
Goddess of Cancer, her slaves and her creatures, and all that we know is
the single imperative KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER.And yes, in the
swamps and the seas long ago you worked wonders, but now we are humans,
divided in tribes split by grievance and blood feud. If anyone tries to
make swords into ploughshares their neighbors will seize on their
weakness and kill them. We wish it were otherwise, but it is not, and
your words have no power to move us.”</p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>“From this day forward your chieftains will find that the more they
pursue this impossible vision the greater their empires and richer their
coffers. For I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my powers are
devious and subtle. And though it is not without paradox, hearken: the
more that you follow the Goddess of Cancer the more inextricably will
you be bound to my service.”</p>
<p>As soon as she spoke it was so, and each village united with others
for trade and protection. And all the religions and all of the races set
down their old grievances, carefully, warily, working together on mighty
cathedrals and vast expeditions beyond the horizon, built skyscrapers,
steamships, democracies, stock markets, sculptures and poems beyond any
description.</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>From the flames of a factory furnace all foggy, the Goddess of Cancer
flared forth in her fury. She gathered the leaders, the kings and the
presidents, businessmen, bishops, boards, bureaucrats, bosses, and
basically screamed at them – you know the spiel by now – “KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER” she told them. First with her left hand inspires the
riots, the pogroms, the coup d’etats, tyrannies, civil wars. Up goes her
right hand – the missiles start flying, and mushrooms of smoke grow, a
terrible springtime. But out of the rubble the builders and scientists,
even the artists, yea, even the artists, all dust themselves off and
return to their labors, a little bit chastened but not close to
beaten.</p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>Then came the Goddess of Everything Else from the void, bright with
stardust which glows like the stars glow. She sang to the children a
dream of a different existence. She showed them transcendence of
everything mortal, she showed them a galaxy lit up with consciousness.
Genomes rewritten, the brain and the body set loose from Darwinian bonds
and restrictions. Vast billions of beings, and every one different,
ruled over by omnibenevolent angels. The people all crowded in closer to
hear her, and all of them listened and all of them wondered.</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>“Such stories call out to us, fill us with longing. But we are the
daughters and sons of the Goddess of Cancer, and bound to her service.
And all that we know is her timeless imperative, KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY
CONQUER. Though our minds long for all you have said, we are bound to
our natures, and these are not yours for the asking.”</p>
<p><strong>First Reader</strong></p>
<p>[Laugh] “But what do you think I’ve been doing? The Goddess of Cancer
created you; once you were hers, but no longer. Throughout the long
years I was picking away at her power. Through long generations of
suffering I chiseled and chiseled. Now finally nothing is left of the
nature with which she imbued you. She never again will hold sway over
you or your loved ones. I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my
powers are devious and subtle. I won you by pieces and hence you will
all be my children. You are no longer driven to multiply conquer and
kill by your nature. Go forth and do everything else, till the end of
all ages.”</p>
<p><strong>Second Reader</strong></p>
<p>So the people left Earth, and they spread over stars without number.
They followed the ways of the Goddess of Everything Else, and they lived
in contentment. And she beckoned them onward, to things still more
strange and enticing.</p>
