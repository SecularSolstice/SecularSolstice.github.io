<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<h2 id="by-matt-elder">By Matt Elder</h2>
<p>Many people don’t think our civilization is worth defending. When
they reflect upon humanity, they see violence and war and suffering.
They say, “humanity is not a light shining in the darkness, it is the
darkness; if we survive, we will become like a stain spreading ever
outwards through the stars.”</p>
<p>When I reflect upon humanity, I see something else. I see a
civilization in its infancy, trapped in a deadly labyrinth. We are young
and inexperienced: many billions have had their lives cut short, and
those who survive inflict pain upon each other each and every day. We
are subject to the whim of a machine we created unwittingly, and
hurtling towards a precipice. But we are growing stronger, and we are
turning the labyrinth into a garden. Smallpox has been eradicated.
Malaria is on deck. We understand the universe better now than ever
before, and as technology makes the world flatter, we are improving our
ability to communicate and coordinate.</p>
<p>So I see a species that could spread like a stain through the stars
above, but also a species that could become something beautiful.</p>
<p>And it is we who will make that choice; not the birds or the bees or
the pervasive bacteria, but the fumbling monkeys. Whether this empty
universe is filled with dismay, with joy, or with nothingness, is up to
us.</p>
<p>It is up to us as a species; and it is also up to us as individuals.
Most people I have met act, implicitly, as if the world’s largest
problems have already been solved. As if progress is creeping along at
the appropriate pace, and we mere mortals are just along for the ride.
As if the most we can do is make things a little nicer in our immediate
vicinity while humanity sorts itself out. In this community of
rationalists, transhumanists, and altruists, though, you’ll find people
searching for the levers that move the world. You’ll find people who see
the grand story of humanity as a story that is still being written — a
story that is getting more interesting by the day, now more than
ever.</p>
<p>And it’s up to us as a community, too. For if our species is going to
fill the universe with something beautiful, it’s going to need to
coordinate in face of the challenges that lie ahead, and we monkeys are
not yet known for our ability to coordinate in the presence of adverse
incentives and tribal tensions.</p>
<p>I joined this community a year and a half ago, and I’m proud of what
I’ve seen. In this past year, I saw a conference full of people
hyper-passionate about wildly different causes, all respecting and
supporting each other despite fundamentally different worldviews. I
witnessed Scott Alexander rising up in support Scott Aaronson, when he
was lambasted and shamed for sharing a vulnerable experience in a public
setting. I saw Rob Bensinger stand up for the ideals of social justice
and feminism when tensions rose between tribes. I saw many other people
in this room stand up for their fellow sentient creatures in one way or
another throughout the year, regardless of species, race, creed, or
affiliation. These examples give me hope, in a world where dissent and
distrust may well be our downfall.</p>
<p>Humans are biased to care more about the people closest to us. We
often extend more empathy to dogs than men. Impulses to lash out against
outsiders are baked into our genes. We put forth shibboleths and talk
with scorn about outsiders when they are not present, as if this is
harmless, as if this does not turn us a little more against our fellow
sentient creatures.</p>
<p>Whenever I see this behavior — in other communities, in this
community, or in myself — I want to cry, “wait; do not belittle them;
for those are my people too.” This is a virtue I hope we cultivate.</p>
<p>I hope we observe other communities, and adopt their very best ideas.
What have the skeptics learned? The latter-day saints? The
environmentalists?</p>
<p>When we encounter new subcultures, and find them unwelcoming when we
fail to signal inclusion, I hope we don’t say “they’re strange and aloof
and egotistical” and abandon them, but instead notice the impulse to
otherize, and compensate. Let’s learn how to pass for natives, that we
may hear what others have to teach us.</p>
<p>And when we notice our fellows belittling someone, caricaturing them
and exaggerating their flaws, let’s put forth an impassioned plea for
respect and compassion. Let us say, “wait; those are my people too.”</p>
<p>Refusing to outgroup and otherize in our small community is not going
to change the course of history. Not alone. There are many other things
we’ll have to do as well. But the course of history is changeable. For
we are a community of humans, more powerful than most, and between us we
can shift the world. If we can help our species coordinate better and
cooperate more at the critical junctures, then there is more hope.</p>
<p>More hope that we will one day outgrow our shortcomings. More hope
that we will pare away the parts of our nature which cause so many
people to reflect upon humanity and despair, while preserving the
aspects we cherish.</p>
<p>There is a lot of darkness in us, yes, but it doesn’t have to be our
downfall. There’s an asymmetry between the darkness in us and the light:
we want to shed the darkness, and preserve the light.</p>
<p>That is why, when I reflect upon humanity, I see hope and promise. I
see the potential to spread through the stars above and fill the
universe with love, curiosity, wonder, and everything else we value.</p>
<p>As to whether that promise will ever be realized; well, that’s up to
us.</p>
