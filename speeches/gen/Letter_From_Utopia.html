<h1 id="letter-from-utopia">Letter from Utopia</h1>
<h2 id="by-nick-bostrom-excerpted-by-daniel-speyer">by Nick Bostrom, excerpted by Daniel Speyer</h2>
<p>Nick Bostrom – the same Nick Bostrom who gave us that “Disneyland with no Children” image from earlier – also wrote what he called a “letter from utopia”. The full text is long, but in it he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever experienced a moment of bliss? On the rapids of inspiration maybe, your mind tracing the shapes of truth and beauty? Or in the pulsing ecstasy of love? Or in a glorious triumph achieved with true friends? Or in a conversation on a vine-overhung terrace one star-appointed night? Or perhaps a melody smuggled itself into your heart, charming it and setting it alight with kaleidoscopic emotions? Or when you prayed, and felt heard?</p>
<p>Yet a little later, scarcely an hour gone by, and the ever-falling soot of ordinary life is already covering the whole thing. The silver and gold of exuberance lose their shine, and the marble becomes dirty.</p>
<p>And so, the door that was ajar begins to close, and so the sliver of hope wanes, until nothing remains but a closed possibility. And then, not even a possibility. Not even a conceivability.</p>
<p>Quick, stop that door from closing! Shove your foot in so it does not slam shut.</p>
<p>And let the faint draught of the beyond continue to whisper of a higher state. Feel it on your face, the tender words of what could be!</p>
