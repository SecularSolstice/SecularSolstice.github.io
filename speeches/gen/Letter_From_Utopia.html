excerpted by Daniel Speyer</h2>
<p>Nick Bostrom – the same Nick Bostrom who gave us that “Disneyland
with no Children” image from earlier – also wrote what he called a
“letter from utopia”. The full text is long, but in it he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever experienced a moment of bliss? On the rapids of
inspiration maybe, your mind tracing the shapes of truth and beauty? Or
in the pulsing ecstasy of love? Or in a glorious triumph achieved with
true friends? Or in a conversation on a vine-overhung terrace one
star-appointed night? Or perhaps a melody smuggled itself into your
heart, charming it and setting it alight with kaleidoscopic emotions? Or
when you prayed, and felt heard?</p>
<p>Yet a little later, scarcely an hour gone by, and the ever-falling
soot of ordinary life is already covering the whole thing. The silver
and gold of exuberance lose their shine, and the marble becomes
dirty.</p>
<p>And so, the door that was ajar begins to close, and so the sliver of
hope wanes, until nothing remains but a closed possibility. And then,
not even a possibility. Not even a conceivability.</p>
<p>Quick, stop that door from closing! Shove your foot in so it does not
slam shut.</p>
<p>And let the faint draught of the beyond continue to whisper of a
higher state. Feel it on your face, the tender words of what could
be!</p>
