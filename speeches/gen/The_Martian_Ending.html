<p>If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a
search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an
earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency
supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it’s found in every
culture without exception. Yes, there are [jerks] who just don’t care,
but they’re massively outnumbered by the people who do. And because of
that, I have billions of people on my side.</p>
