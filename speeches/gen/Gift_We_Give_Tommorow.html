<h2 id="by-eliezer-yudkowsky-and-raymond-arnold">By Eliezer Yudkowsky
and Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>How, oh how could the universe,<br />
itself unloving, and mindless,<br />
cough up creatures capable of love?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No mystery in that.<br />
It’s just a matter<br />
of natural selection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But natural selection is cruel. Bloody.<br />
And bloody stupid!</p>
<p>Even when organisms <em>aren’t</em> directly tearing at each other’s
throats…<br />
…there’s a deeper competition, going on between the genes.<br />
A species could evolve to extinction,<br />
if the winning genes were playing negative sum games</p>
<p>How could a process,<br />
Cruel as Azathoth,<br />
Create minds that were capable of love?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No mystery.</p>
<p>Mystery is a property of questions.<br />
Not answers.</p>
<p>A mother’s child shares her genes,<br />
And so a mother loves her child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But mothers can adopt their children.<br />
And still, come to love them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still no mystery.</p>
<p>Evolutionary psychology isn’t about deliberately maximizing
fitness.<br />
Through most of human history,<br />
we didn’t know genes existed.<br />
Even subconsciously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, fine. But still:</p>
<p>Humans form friendships,<br />
even with non-relatives.<br />
How can that be?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No mystery.</p>
<p>Ancient hunter-gatherers would often play the Iterated Prisoner’s
Dilemma.<br />
There could be profit in betrayal.<br />
But the best solution:<br />
was reciprocal altruism.</p>
<p>Sometimes,<br />
the most dangerous human is not the strongest,<br />
the prettiest,<br />
or even the smartest:<br />
But the one who has the most allies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not all friends are fair-weather friends;<br />
there are <em>true</em> friends -<br />
those who would sacrifice their lives for another.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t that kind of devotion<br />
remove itself from the gene pool?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You said it yourself:<br />
We have a concept of true friendship and fair-weather friendship.<br />
We wouldn’t be true friends with someone who we didn’t think was a true
friend to us.<br />
And one with many true friends?<br />
They are far more formidable<br />
than one with mere fair-weather allies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mohandas Gandhi,<br />
who really did turn the other cheek?<br />
Those who try to serve all humanity,<br />
whether or not all humanity serves them in turn?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s a more complex story.<br />
Humans aren’t just social animals.<br />
We’re political animals.<br />
Sometimes the formidable human is not the strongest,<br />
but the one who skillfully argues that their preferred policies<br />
match the preferences of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Um… what?<br />
How does that explain Gandhi?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point is that we can argue about ‘What should be done?’<br />
We can make those arguments and respond to them.<br />
Without that, politics couldn’t take place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay… but Gandhi?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Believed certain complicated propositions about ‘What should be
done?’<br />
Then did them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds suspiciously like it could explain any possible human
behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we traced back the chain of causality,<br />
through all the arguments…<br />
We’d find a moral architecture.<br />
The ability to argue abstract propositions.<br />
A preference for simple ideas.<br />
An appeal to hardwired intuitions about fairness.<br />
A concept of duty. Aversion to pain.<br />
Empathy.</p>
<p>Filtered by memetic selection,<br />
all of this resulted in a concept:<br />
“You should not hurt people,”<br />
In full generality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that gets you Gandhi?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What else would you suggest?<br />
Some godlike figure?<br />
Reaching out from behind the scenes,<br />
directing evolution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hell no. But -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because then I’d would have to ask :<br />
How did that god originally decide that love was even desirable.<br />
How it got preferences that included things like friendship, loyalty,
and fairness.</p>
<p>Call it ‘surprising’ all you like.<br />
But through evolutionary psychology,<br />
You can see how parental love, romance, honor,<br />
even true altruism and moral arguments,<br />
<em>all bear the specific design signature of natural
selection.</em></p>
<p>If there were some benevolent god,<br />
reaching out to create a world of loving humans,<br />
it too must have evolved,<br />
defeating the point of postulating it at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not postulating a god!<br />
I’m just asking how human beings ended up so <em>nice.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nice?</em><br />
Have you looked at this planet lately?<br />
We bear all those other emotions that evolved as well.<br />
Which should make it very clear that we evolved,<br />
should you begin to doubt it.</p>
<p>Humans aren’t always nice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, still, come on…<br />
doesn’t it seem a little…<br />
amazing?</p>
<p>That nothing but millions of years of a cosmic death
tournament…<br />
could cough up mothers and fathers,<br />
sisters and brothers,<br />
husbands and wives,<br />
steadfast friends,<br />
honorable enemies,<br />
true altruists and guardians of causes,<br />
police officers and loyal defenders,<br />
even artists, sacrificing themselves for their art?</p>
<p>All practicing so many kinds of love?<br />
For so many things other than genes?</p>
<p>Doing their part to make their world less ugly,<br />
something besides a sea of blood and violence and mindless
replication?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you honestly surprised by this?<br />
If so, question your underlying model.<br />
For it’s led you to be surprised by the true state of affairs.</p>
<p>Since the very beginning,<br />
not one unusual thing<br />
has ever happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>But how are you <em>not</em> amazed?</p>
<p>Maybe there’s no surprise from a causal viewpoint.</p>
<p>But still, it seems to me,<br />
in the creation of humans by evolution,<br />
something happened that is precious and marvelous and wonderful.</p>
<p>If we can’t call it a physical miracle, then call it a moral
miracle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it was only a miracle from the perspective of the morality
that was produced?<br />
Explaining away all the apparent coincidence,<br />
from a causal and physical perspective?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well… yeah. I suppose you could interpret it that way.</p>
<p>I just meant that something was immensely surprising and wonderful on
a moral level,<br />
even if it’s not really surprising,<br />
on a physical level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that’s what I said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It just seems to me that in your view, somehow you explain that
wonder away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. </p>
<p>I explain it.</p>
<p>Of course there’s a story behind love.<br />
Behind all ordered events, one finds ordered stories.<br />
And that which has no story is nothing but random noise.<br />
Hardly any better.</p>
<p>If you can’t take joy in things with true stories behind them,<br />
your life will be empty.</p>
<p>Love has to begin somehow.<br />
It has to enter the universe somewhere.<br />
It’s like asking how life itself begins.<br />
Though you were born of your father and mother,<br />
and though they arose from their living parents in turn,<br />
if you go far and far and far away back,<br />
you’ll finally come to a replicator that arose by pure accident.<br />
The border between life and unlife.<br />
So too with love.</p>
<p>A complex pattern must be explained by a cause<br />
that’s not already that complex pattern.<br />
For love to enter the universe,<br />
it has to arise from something that is not love.<br />
If that weren’t possible, then love could not be.</p>
<p>Just as life itself required that first replicator,<br />
to come about by accident,<br />
parentless,<br />
but still caused:<br />
far, far back in the causal chain that led to you:<br />
3.8 billion years ago,<br />
in some little tidal pool.</p>
<p>Perhaps your children’s children will ask,<br />
how it is that they are capable of love.<br />
And their parents will say:<br />
Because we, who also love, created you to love.</p>
<p>And your children’s children may ask:<br />
But how is it that you love?</p>
<p>And their parents will reply:<br />
Because our own parents,<br />
who loved as well,<br />
created us to love in turn.</p>
<p>And then your children’s children will ask:<br />
But where did it all begin?<br />
Where does the recursion end?</p>
<p>And their parents will say:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Once upon a time, </em><br />
<em>long ago and far away,</em><br />
<em>there were intelligent beings who were not themselves intelligently
designed.</em></p>
<p><em>Once upon a time, </em><br />
<em>there were lovers, </em><br />
<em>created by something that did not love.</em></p>
<p><em>Once upon a time, </em><br />
<em>when all of civilization was a single galaxy,</em><br />
<em>A single star.</em><br />
<em>A single planet.</em><br />
<em>A place called Earth.</em></p>
<p><em>Long ago, </em><br />
<em>Far away,</em><br />
<em>Ever So Long Ago.</em></p>
