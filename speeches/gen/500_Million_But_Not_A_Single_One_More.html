<p>We will never know their names.</p>
<p>The first victim could not have been recorded, for there was no
written language to record it. They were someone’s daughter, or son, and
someone’s friend, and they were loved by those around them. And they
were in pain, covered in rashes, confused, scared, not knowing why this
was happening to them or what they could do about it – victim of a mad,
inhuman god. There was nothing to be done – humanity was not strong
enough, not aware enough, not knowledgeable enough, to fight back
against a monster that could not be seen.</p>
<p>It was in Ancient Egypt, where it attacked slave and pharaoh alike.
In Rome, it effortlessly decimated armies. It killed in Syria. It killed
in Moscow. In India, five million dead. It killed a thousand Europeans
every day in the 18th century. It killed more than fifty million Native
Americans. From the Peloponnesian War to the Civil War, it slew more
soldiers and civilians than any weapon, any soldier, any army (Not that
this stopped the most foolish and empty souls from attempting to harness
the demon as a weapon against their enemies).</p>
<p>Cultures grew and faltered, and it remained. Empires rose and fell,
and it thrived. Ideologies waxed and waned, but it did not care. Kill.
Maim. Spread. An ancient, mad god, hidden from view, that could not be
fought, could not be confronted, could not even be comprehended. Not the
only one of its kind, but the most devastating.</p>
<p>For a long time, there was no hope – only the bitter, hollow
endurance of survivors.</p>
<p>In China, in the 10th century, humanity began to fight back.</p>
<p>It was observed that survivors of the mad god’s curse would never be
touched again: they had taken a portion of that power into themselves,
and were so protected from it. Not only that, but this power could be
shared by consuming a remnant of the wounds. There was a price, for you
could not take the god’s power without first defeating it – but a
smaller battle, on humanity’s terms. By the 16th century, the technique
spread, to India, across Asia, the Ottoman Empire and, in the 18th
century, Europe. In 1796, a more powerful technique was discovered by
Edward Jenner.</p>
<p>An idea began to take hold: Perhaps the ancient god could be
killed.</p>
<p>A whisper became a voice; a voice became a call; a call became a
battle cry, sweeping across villages, cities, nations. Humanity began to
cooperate, spreading the protective power across the globe, dispatching
masters of the craft to protect whole populations. People who had once
been sworn enemies joined in common cause for this one battle.
Governments mandated that all citizens protect themselves, for giving
the ancient enemy a single life would put millions in danger.</p>
<p>And, inch by inch, humanity drove its enemy back. Fewer friends wept;
Fewer neighbors were crippled; Fewer parents had to bury their
children.</p>
<p>At the dawn of the 20th century, for the first time, humanity
banished the enemy from entire regions of the world. Humanity faltered
many times in its efforts, but there individuals who never gave up, who
fought for the dream of a world where no child or loved one would ever
fear the demon ever again. Viktor Zhdanov, who called for humanity to
unite in a final push against the demon; The great tactician Karel
Raška, who conceived of a strategy to annihilate the enemy; Donald
Henderson, who led the efforts of those final days.</p>
<p>The enemy grew weaker. Millions became thousands, thousands became
dozens. And then, when the enemy did strike, scores of humans came forth
to defy it, protecting all those whom it might endanger.</p>
<p>The enemy’s last attack in the wild was on Ali Maow Maalin, in 1977.
For months afterwards, dedicated humans swept the surrounding area,
seeking out any last, desperate hiding place where the enemy might yet
remain.</p>
<p>They found none.</p>
<p>35 years ago, on December 9th, 1979, humanity declared victory.</p>
<p>This one evil, the horror from beyond memory, the monster that took
500 million people from this world – was destroyed.</p>
<p>You are a member of the species that did that. Never forget what we
are capable of, when we band together and declare battle on what is
broken in the world.</p>
