<h1 id="prediction-ozone">Prediction: Ozone</h1>
<p>In 1986, William Mansfield of the United Nations Environment Programme wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that the potential dangers to the ozone layer from Man-made chemical releases will require emission controls. Adverse consequences can flow from the smallest depletion. A <em>single</em> percentage-point loss of ozone can induce a six per cent increase in certain types of disfiguring skin-cancer. Yet projections of ozone depletion related to <em>zero growth</em> of CFC emissions approach <em>five</em> per cent, and with only moderate growth double-figure depletions are projected.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We’ll never know how bad the skin cancer would have gotten, because we got the emission controls instead. Less than a year after he wrote that, the world’s governments – guided by meteorologists and aided by chemists – agreed to a gradual but complete phase-out of CFCs. Within ten years, the ozone layer was showing clear signs of recovery.</p>
