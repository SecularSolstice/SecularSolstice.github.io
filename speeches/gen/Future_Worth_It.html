<p>Are you hungry right now? I suspect a few of you will answer, yes.
Now, have you eaten in last three or four days? I suspect no one reading
this will answer, no. That is something to be celebrated. Most animals
in the wild struggle to find food. Natural selection is a ruthless
optimizer. If there is surplus food, the population will grow until some
members go hungry. Early humans were no exception. Many humans still
don’t get enough to eat today. But hunger is an enemy on the run, and
it’s end is within sight.</p>
<p>The move to agriculture greatly increased how much food we could
produce. It didn’t solve hunger, but it did lay the foundation. It
wasn’t until the green revolution and the age of industrial farming that
we finally began to push back the tides of malnutrition and starvation.
With the selective breeding of crops, nitrogen based fertilizers, and
farming machines, more and more people had enough food to eat.</p>
<p>We’re not done. Far too many people still lack ample food, but
against this enemy, we will prevail. We will engineer more efficient,
more robust crops. We will keep experimenting, learning the
relationships between pollinators and plants, soil and microfauna,
farmers and buyers. We will engineer new kinds of foods, from algae,
bacteria and fungi. We won’t be limited by arable land. We will learn
the secrets of photosynthesis and take those secrets to the stars. Can
you picture it? Abundant food on Mars, in space, wherever we want to
grow it, synthesize it, will it into existence.</p>
<p>But hunger is merely the first great enemy we will banish.</p>
<p>There are other enemies.</p>
<p>Disease.</p>
<p>Mental illness.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>Aging.</p>
<p>Death itself.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, we humans are great at demonizing the
outgroup, the enemy. Well, if we are to hate, let us hate these
enemies.</p>
<p>Malaria, cholera, HIV, flu, we have a message for you, listen
closely. Fuck you! We don’t need you. You will not be permitted to keep
taking our kin, our people. We will outsmart you. We will drive you to
extinction. You will go the way of smallpox and polio, and every other
disease will follow. We will use vaccines, gene drives, whatever it
takes, and we will defeat you.</p>
<p>And we won’t stop there, not by half. We learn to understand how our
brains function. We will defeat depression, alzheimers, brain cancer. We
will learn the function of every gene, every strand of RNA. We will
learn what causes our bodies to senesce and decay, and we will reverse
it. No longer will we be forced to grow old and sick, wrinkled and
unable to run and play. Never again will a loved one be ripped away from
us by a death they did not choose.</p>
<p>The future where we humans triumph over disease and death is more
than possible. It is within reach. No law of physics or chemistry dooms
our bodies to age and die. We are weak and sick and hungry because that
was the best evolution could do. But we do not need to remain slaves of
evolutionary history.</p>
<p>Every part of our body is an organic machine. There is no soul beyond
our comprehension.The stuff our brains do, that’s who we are. And we are
fixable. Our internal systems can be improved, made more modular, more
replaceable. Immortality isn’t a pipe dream, it’s an engineering
challenge.</p>
<p>I won’t stand here and tell you that our glorious future, free from
hunger and disease, is inevitable. It is not. There is no God to guide
us to the promised land. There is no universal force to bring peace and
happiness to all. Those who believe some god will come in the end and
save everyone, solve everything, may not feel any special urgency to
act. But we don’t have that luxury.</p>
<p>Solving these problems won’t be easy. The end of hunger, the end of
disease, the end of death itself, these are obtainable. But if we are to
obtain them, we must do the building ourselves.</p>
<p>You, and me, us. We must build the gene drives. We must develop the
vaccines. We must prevent nuclear war, runaway climate change, and
unfriendly artificial intelligence. This can be done, must be done, and
humans are the only ones to do it.</p>
<p>A future filled with flourishing lives is one with fighting for. When
the last hungry person is fed, the last disease vanquished, the last
riddle of human biology solved, then our work will be done. We will
smile, and laugh, and cry together.</p>
<p>And finally, at last, we will declare victory!</p>
