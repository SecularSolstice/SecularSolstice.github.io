<h1 id="prediction-phenotypes">Prediction: Phenotypes</h1>
<p>In 2018, Scott Alexander predicted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Polygenic scores [will] go public – not necessarily by 2023, but not long after. It [will] become possible to look at your 23andMe results and get a weak estimate of your height, IQ, criminality, et cetera.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A service to do exactly this – not especially well, but as well as cutting edge research allowed – had already been in service for a year and a half when the prediction was made.</p>
