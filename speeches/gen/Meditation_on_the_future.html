Soares</h2>
<p>The journey of humanity is not yet over.</p>
<p>With luck, or more likely, dedication and skill, we have a long way
yet to travel.</p>
<p>There’s a lot happening in the present vying for our immediate
attention.</p>
<p>But one important property that separates us from the other apes is
our ability to plan for the long-term. To imagine a better world and
then work to bring it into existence.</p>
<p>So now I’d like us to take a step back aqnd think on that big
picture.</p>
<p>The future is coming, whether we are ready or not.</p>
<p>It can be hard enough to plan for the next week, never mind the next
year, never mind the next decade. But decades are only a tiny sliver of
the human story. Our story is thousands, in some ways millions, of years
old. And if things go well, it’s nowhere near close to done. Predicting
the future is difficult and it’s hard to tell specific stories about it.
But there will be specific things happening.</p>
<p>So I’d like to end tonight with a question: What do you imagine?</p>
<p>What’ll have become of humanity millennia from now?</p>
<p>The future may be strange beyond our ability to visualize, but we are
not completely blind, and our ability to foresee good or ill is key to
our ability to steer the future’s course.</p>
<p>So when you look ahead, what do you see? And one more question: what
do you want to see?</p>
<p>If things go well, if humanity makes it off of this rock alive, if
you could nudge the universe onto a better path, with direction would
you nudge it?</p>
<p>Where are we going and who shall we become?</p>
