<p><em>[Originally written as a rap, could be recited that way or
not]</em></p>
<p>The reason that I’m not a nihilist<br />
Is some day I wanna live like in Star Trek<br />
And I know that we’ll never build starships<br />
Until we tackle poverty, war, and hardship</p>
<p>So we fight overnight and over lifetimes<br />
Organize for that warp drive<br />
And of course I realize<br />
That we’re a long way from it<br />
But what better reason to start runnin’?</p>
<p>Cause if you’re gonna do the work then it’s gotta be honest<br />
Because the best of us have all already been forgotten<br />
And if you’re in it for the recognition<br />
I hate to disappoint but if you do it right you’ll never get it</p>
<p>Yo, we don’t remember the farmer<br />
We remember the fruit<br />
We don’t remember the inventor<br />
We remember the boom<br />
The impact through the eons<br />
So I know what side of history I wanna be on</p>
<p>I got a lot of ancestors on my side<br />
Got a ancestor took an arrow to the chest and survived<br />
I got an ancestor who cheated and lied<br />
I got an ancestor who taught her children how to fight</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So much spirit in my corner<br />
Can’t help but color outside every border<br />
To every ancestor who kept my song alive<br />
I swear on your unmarked graves<br />
I will sing it ’til I die</p>
<p>No friction; no flame;<br />
No struggle; no progress;<br />
No sweat<br />
How many times do we have to win<br />
’Til you realize that we have not lost yet?<br />
No friction; no flame;<br />
No struggle; no progress;<br />
No sweat<br />
How many times do we have to win<br />
’Til you realize that we are not lost yet?</p>
<p>What is it, yeah?</p>
<p>What is it?<br />
If it ain’t somethin’<br />
Then it’s the other thing<br />
That’s bothering me<br />
Haagar the Horrible<br />
Most rhetorical lesson ever received<br />
Was there was no need<br />
For no money, no greed<br />
Only prophecy, shit</p>
<p>I’m inspired by this openness in other matters<br />
Scream at the wall and hope it shatters<br />
Into a thousand pieces<br />
Enemy of the state is what I became<br />
Wearing Patti Smith’s marching shoes</p>
<p>Rock and roll, nigga, I became, become<br />
Why am I the only one who looks different?<br />
Paint me as the new eccentric<br />
If I had it my way Minneapolis would be Piss Christ<br />
Spinning in hell above the lakes<br />
No one even knows the names of and if you do<br />
You have too much time on your fucking hands<br />
That’s why you pace about the room trying not to give a damn</p>
<p>I’m kicking down the door<br />
Like I did inside the womb<br />
Pause ’til the interlude<br />
There’s something funky to you<br />
Forget whatever you thought you knew<br />
Cause none of that bullshit will serve you<br />
I’ll be there in due time<br />
Until then:</p>
<p>No friction; no flame;<br />
No struggle; no progress;<br />
No sweat<br />
How many times do we have to win<br />
’Til you realize that we have not lost yet?<br />
No friction; no flame;<br />
No struggle; no progress;<br />
No sweat<br />
How many times do we have to win<br />
’Til you realize that we are not lost yet?</p>
<p>There are no stories told in a vacuum<br />
There is no prophecy lighting our way<br />
There is just a lot of darkness to be afraid of<br />
So it’s a good thing we are not afraid</p>
<p>There is no Superman in that phone booth<br />
There is no rewarding our faith<br />
There is no one who can save us<br />
So it’s a good thing we don’t need to be saved</p>
<p>There are no starships in low earth orbit<br />
No aliens to save us from ourselves<br />
There is no voice willing to speak for us<br />
So it’s a good thing we know how to yell!</p>
<p>There is no chosen one, no destiny, no fate<br />
There’s no such thing as magic<br />
There is no light at the end of this tunnel<br />
So it’s a good thing we brought matches</p>
