<h2 id="by-laura-vaughan">By Laura Vaughan</h2>
<p>It can feel overwhelming to think about the future.</p>
<p>I don’t have easy answers here. I do know it is possible to pick
oneself up in most situations, and where I imagine most people are at is
no exception.</p>
<p>That’s easy to know in theory. It’s much harder to know the steps to
get there.</p>
<p>In 2018, I was living through the worst year of my life, the world
shattered around me. I tried a lot of things to get out of that dark
place, but ultimately there wasn’t any single solution, given the
complexity that life is often made up of.</p>
<p>In some ways, I’m still working on getting better.</p>
<p>And though this year has actually been pretty good for my own
personal healing, I still remember what it was like back then,
constantly looking toward the future, dwelling in what I had lost, and
feeling afraid that I wouldn’t be able to make it back.</p>
<p>During whatever period one might call normal, the usual things that
come to mind when looking toward the future are pretty big. It can be
tempting to follow those same familiar scripts, even when the world
shifted. What career shifts will I make? What are the next steps to
accomplish my goals? How can I have an impact?</p>
<p>But, if you’re like me, when you don’t have a stable foundation,
those can feel so overwhelming and detached from the current reality
that you feel lost.</p>
<p>The thing is, realistically, all of that big picture stuff takes a
thousand little things to even work.</p>
<p>If you have grand goals, those little things might seem
inconsequential by comparison. You might not even <em>notice</em> how
important they are, how they support you.</p>
<p>But these steps matter to building a better future. Because maybe you
can’t change the world in one night.</p>
<p>Keeping in touch with friends, getting good sleep. Eating well, or
you know, whatever well means for you. Taking vitamin D. And watering
your plants.</p>
<p>Maybe you set aside some time to care for the people you love, to get
to sleep a bit earlier, or to finally write that post that you were
hoping to all those months ago. All these little things can work towards
stability and strength.</p>
<p>For me, at least, that was crucial.</p>
<p>I had to take several steps back and take a break. And work on the
smaller things. And it took far longer than I’d like to admit to realize
that.</p>
<p>I wish that I’d figured out how to feel okay, focusing on the little
things sooner. Such that brighter futures seemed more possible.</p>
<p>So while I can’t give an exact roadmap, here’s a suggestion if you’re
struggling: it’s okay to focus on the now.</p>
<p>On a smaller scope of what you can do, and what you can control. You
can think about yourself; you can think about your friends, your family,
your loved ones. You can think about this next minute, this next day,
this next week. Think about the smaller things that bring you light.</p>
<p>Now, looking around, even through the limited interface, I can see a
lot of people in this room. Some of us know each other pretty well.
Others, maybe not so much. But regardless of how we got here, we are all
here, together, celebrating the longest night of the year. There’s a lot
of light here. That’s pretty special. Remember that.</p>
<p>And remember that many of your peers here are fighting for brighter
futures, too.</p>
<p>There are futures that are worth protecting. And it’s worth taking
those little steps to get to them be those steps taken alone or
together.</p>
<p>So even if the light at the end of the tunnel seems dim from where
you are, remember that there is still a light somewhere.</p>
<p>Remember that you are not alone in this fight.</p>
<p>Though we can’t be together physically, or working on the same things
in each moment, we can at least be together in spirit.</p>
<p>To borrow from another Solstice speech: We are each a part of the
story of humanity. Our pursuit of truth, our pursuit of meaning, and our
pursuit of happiness, in some ways they are incredibly fragile. But
compared to any one of us, they are incredibly difficult to
extinguish.</p>
<p>We, the people here tonight, and the people on this planet, we have
the power to shape our stories, to bring light to their darkness, and to
guide them into the future.</p>
<p>Together, we can bring light.</p>
<p>We will find a way through this.</p>
