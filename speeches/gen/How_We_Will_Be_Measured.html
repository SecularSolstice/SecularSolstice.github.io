<h2 id="by-nate-soares">By Nate Soares</h2>
<p>When all is said and done, and Nature passes her final judgement, <a
href="http://mindingourway.com/stop-before-you-drop/">you will not be
measured by the number of moments in which you worked as hard as you
could</a>. You will not be judged by someone rooting around in your mind
to see <a href="http://mindingourway.com/there-are-no/">whether you were
good or bad</a>. You will not be evaluated according to how <a
href="http://mindingourway.com/have-no-excuses/">unassailable your
explanations are</a>, for why the things that you couldn’t possibly have
prevented the things that went wrong.</p>
<p>You will be measured only by what <em>actually happens,</em> as will
we all.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean all of us are using the same measuring stick: Some
people are working to ensure that our universe-history is one in which
they in particular have a happy and fulfilled life; others are working
to ensure that our universe-history is one in which their children never
have to debase themselves to survive. Still others look wide, and see
poverty and destitution and suffering, and work to ensure that those
blemishes fade from our universe-history, in the places they can reach,
near the time of their lives. Others look far forward, working to ensure
that our universe-history is full of flourishing sentient civilizations
and other nice things.</p>
<p>All it means is that the <em>type</em> of thing we’re all trying to
do, one way or another, is ensure that the actual history of our
universe, the actual timeless structure of the place we’re embedded, is
as desirable as possible. That’s the type of game we’re playing: We
manipulate universe-histories, for the sake of the future.</p>
<p>Some people have a listless guilt, thinking that nothing matters but
feeling vaguely restless as they watch themselves spend their lives on
things they think are pointless. Other people have a pointed guilt,
thinking that <em>everything</em> matters, and berating themselves
whenever they fall short of perfection. For me, the framing that <em>we
act to determine the shape of our actual universe-history</em> is a
framing that avoids both these pitfalls. Is there a way you want the
completed, timeless story of our universe to go? Then act to ensure that
the future is as good as you can make it. Are you wracked with guilt
about your inability to act as you wish, or regret for the things you
did in the past? Then act to ensure that the future is as good as you
can make it. That’s the sort of game we’re playing: At all times, act to
ensure that our future is bright.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think many people get a bit mixed up about what type of game we’re
playing. They get stuck playing a social game, measuring their
accomplishments by comparison to the accomplishments of their neighbors;
or they <a
href="http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/">mistake
someone else’s expectations for their preferences</a> and get stuck
chasing <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/le/lost_purposes/">lost
purposes</a>; or someone slights them and their vision narrows as their
sole objective becomes <em>retaliation.</em></p>
<p>I’m not saying social goals are intrinsically bad. Wealth and status
are useful aids when it comes to determining the future; the
accomplishments and expectations of your peers can provide useful
measurements of your abilities. But there’s a difference between
pursuing social goals for the sake of determining the course of our
universe-history, and forgetting entirely that success is measured in
terms of what actually happens throughout the course of history.</p>
<p>I alluded to this when I described <a
href="http://mindingourway.com/defiance/">defiance</a> as “choosing
self-reliance.” At the end of the day, each and every one of us is
engaged in a personal struggle to determine the future. We are not
<em>alone;</em> there are many around us who can be friends and allies
and support us in our struggle. But the goal, in the end, is to use what
resources we have at our disposal to ensure that the universe-history is
filled with light, whatever our light may be. I hope yours includes
friends and family and loved ones, but <em>making it happen</em> — that
is your personal task. You are encouraged to draw on the support of
friends and allies where possible; and ensuring that you have close
connections may be one of the properties you’re putting into the
timeless history of our universe: But even then, the task of
<em>ensuring our universe-history is one in which you have close
connections</em> is your personal task.</p>
<hr />
<p>What we are doing, on this earth, is acting in such a way that our
future is filled with light. From this framing, “guilt-based motivation”
is a foreign concept: If you start to feel guilty, simply <a
href="http://mindingourway.com/be-a-new-homunculus/">look at your
situation with fresh eyes</a>, and then act such that the future is
filled with light. Our lives are not status competitions; the world is
not a proving ground. We are participating in a <em>gambit for the
future</em> (or, more likely, a gambit for the shape of the multiverse),
and that is all.</p>
<p>When there are people who oppose us out of nothing save for petty
spite; when there are obstacles that stand between us and something
important to us which seem all but insurmountable; when we encounter
personal limitations that prevent us from acting as we wish to; it is
easy to confuse retaliation, overcoming adversity, and growing stronger,
with our actual goals. But crossing those hurdles is not the final
objective: those hurdles are only parameters in our calculations about
how to affect the future; they are nothing but the state of the game
board in a game with cosmic states.</p>
<p>In that game, some people have stronger positions than others, and
more leverage with which to determine the timeless story of our
universe. Life isn’t fair. But all of us, one way or another, are here
to make sure that our universe history is filled with light — whatever
‘light’ may be to each of us.</p>
<p>So find allies, find friends, find everything you need to improve
your ability to ensure that our universe-history tells a story you like.
Move towards whatever levers on our future you can find. And then
<em>fill it with light.</em></p>
