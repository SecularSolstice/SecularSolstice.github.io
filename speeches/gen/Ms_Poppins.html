<h1 id="ms.-poppins">Ms. Poppins</h1>
<p>I thought I knew what I was going for,<br />
as I strode on the ceiling and fell through the door;<br />
I thought I knew what my life was about,<br />
but things kept on changing, turning inside and out.</p>
<p>Then this lady came by with a smile and a song,<br />
proved all that I knew was so horribly wrong –<br />
she taught me once more how to play and rejoice,<br />
that happiness isn’t a gift, it’s a choice.</p>
<p>Suddenly life was no longer a chore<br />
and even the small things were hard to ignore –<br />
life full of joy and painted in color,<br />
all of my problems became so much smaller.</p>
<p>Somewhat bemused, I felt like a child,<br />
carefree and open, lively and wild,<br />
bursting out laughing from jokes I was making<br />
while people were asking which drugs I was taking,</p>
<p>and I thought it was all that one beautiful lady –<br />
my hero, my savior, my lovely, my Mary.<br />
She was my gal and I was her fella,<br />
then one day she left me and took her umbrella.</p>
<p>I thought I knew where our lives were heading –<br />
a gold diamond ring and a beautiful wedding.<br />
Bitter taste in my throat, not a spoon full of sugar,<br />
I felt like a cold piece of meat at the butcher.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get back on my feet<br />
to carry on with my life and to refuse defeat,<br />
remember the things that she thought me, and smile,<br />
because if I look back it was all worth my while.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget you, but I must move on,<br />
with a smile on my face, even though you are gone.<br />
To force you to stay would have been much too greedy,<br />
but I still think about you when I’m cleaning my chimney.</p>
