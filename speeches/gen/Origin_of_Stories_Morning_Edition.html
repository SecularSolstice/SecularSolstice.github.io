<h1 id="origin-of-stories">Origin of Stories</h1>
<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>For billions of years, across the endless darkness, Stars were born,
and burned, and died. And nobody mourned their passing nor thought them
beautiful.</p>
<p>But in the wake of their violent death came new stars, Slowly
evolving over the eons. Denser. Heavier. Until at last, at least one
fragile dot was formed.</p>
<p>And for millions of years, Biological creatures were born and lived
and died, Tearing each other apart. Incapable of mourning one another’s
passing nor seeing beauty in their world. But in the wake of
<em>their</em> deaths came children.</p>
<p>Slowly evolving, not in any particular direction that anyone
intended.</p>
<p>Until, at last, a line was passed: The border between uncaring
matter, And matter arranged into patterns with desires and drive.</p>
<p>The border between unthinking matter, And matter that could
contemplate the patterns around it.</p>
<p>And somewhere, at some point, in those fertile imaginations, The
first ideas took hold. The first stories were told.</p>
<p>And for thousands of years, Stories were born, and lived, and often
but did not always die. They evolved, not in any particular direction,
but neither entirely directionless. We shaped our stories, and they
shaped us in turn.</p>
<p>Stories helped us to thrive and persevere against overwhelming odds.
To trust and help each other when by all rights we should have left each
other to die.</p>
<p>And sometimes, our stories led us to genocide, or to erect
institutions beyond our control, indifferent to our suffering.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We live in a world where suffering and death are part of reality. And
I will not try to tell you that that is somehow okay, because it’s not.
And I will not try to tell you that we will necessarily ever overcome
those things, Because I don’t know whether we can, And tonight is
<em>not</em> about blind hope.</p>
<p>I can tell you we will try.</p>
<p>I can tell you that Carl Sagan… and Edward Jenner, Donald Henderson,
and Ali Maow Maalin… Everyone you’ve ever loved.</p>
<p>Not anyone who ever was but everyone that anyone has <em>heard</em>
of, A small part of those people have survived, their patterns preserved
in the stories we tell.</p>
<p>We preserve those patterns as best we can.</p>
<p>And finally, I can tell you: that we are part of a story that is
bigger than us.</p>
<p>Our pursuit of truth, and our pursuit of happiness - that saga
stretching across the ages. That saga is not invulnerable. It is in some
ways frail. But compared to any one of us it is incredibly difficult to
extinguish.</p>
<p>We are a part of a story that is powerful and beautiful and will
probably outlive us. It will possibly outlive our children. It could
potentially outlive humanity.</p>
<p>And we, the people in this room, the people on this planet, have the
power to shape those stories, and guide them into the future.</p>
