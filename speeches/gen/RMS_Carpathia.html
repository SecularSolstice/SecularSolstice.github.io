<p>The RMS Carpathia received Titanic’s distress signal at 12:20am on
April 15th, 1912. She was 58 miles away, a distance that absolutely
could not be covered in less than four hours.</p>
<p>Upon being woken by a wide-eyed radio operator, Carpathia’s Captain
Rostron rolled out of bed instantly, confirming the signal and ordering
his ship to Titanic’s aid before he was fully dressed. The man had never
in his life responded to an emergency call. His goal tonight was to make
sure nobody who heard that fact would ever believe it.</p>
<p>All of Carpathia’s lifeboats were swung out ready for deployment. Oil
was set up to be poured off the side of the ship in case the sea turned
choppy; oil would coat and calm the water near Carpathia if that
happened, making it safer for lifeboats to draw up alongside her. He
ordered lights to be rigged along the side of the ship so survivors
could see it better, and had nets and ladders rigged along her sides
ready to be dropped when they arrived, in order to let as many survivors
as possible climb aboard at once.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was optimistic to prepare for there being survivors in the
deathly frigid water. I think he knew they were never going to get there
in time for that. I think he did it anyway because, god, you have to
hope.</p>
<p>Carpathia’s three dining rooms were immediately converted into triage
and first aid stations. Each had a doctor assigned to it. Hot soup,
coffee, and tea were prepared in bulk in each dining room, and blankets
and warm clothes were collected to be ready to hand out. By this time,
many of the passengers were awake–prepping a ship for disaster relief
isn’t quiet–and all of them stepped up to help, many donating their own
clothes and blankets. And then he did something I tend to refer to as
diverting all power from life support.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing about steamships: They run on steam. Shocking, I
know; but that steam powers everything on the ship, and right now,
Carpathia needed power. So Rostron turned off hot water and central
heating, which bled valuable steam power, to everywhere but the dining
rooms–which, of course, were being used to make hot drinks and receive
survivors. He woke up all the engineers, all the stokers and firemen,
diverted all that steam back into the engines, and asked his ship to go
as fast as she possibly could. And when she’d done that, he asked her to
go faster.</p>
<p>I need you to understand that you simply can’t push a ship very far
past its top speed. Pushing that much sheer tonnage through the water
becomes harder with each extra knot above the speed it was designed for.
Pushing a ship past its rated speed is not only reckless–it’s difficult
to maneuver–but it puts an incredible amount of strain on the engines.
Ships are not designed to exceed their top speed by even one knot. They
can’t do it. It can’t be done. Carpathia’s absolute do-or-die,
the-engines-can’t-take-this-forever top speed was fourteen knots.
Dodging icebergs, in the dark and the cold, surrounded by mist, she
sustained a speed of almost seventeen and a half.</p>
<p>No one would have asked this of them. It wasn’t expected. They were
almost sixty miles away, with icebergs in their path. They had a
responsibility to respond; they did not have a responsibility to do the
impossible and do it well. No one would have faulted them for taking
more time to confirm the severity of the issue. No one would have blamed
them for a slow and cautious approach. No one but themselves.</p>
<p>They damn near broke the laws of physics, galloping north headlong
into the dark in the desperate hope that if they could shave an hour,
half an hour, five minutes off their arrival time, maybe for one more
person those five minutes would make the difference. I say to you: Three
people had died by the time the crew of the Carpathia lifted them from
the lifeboats. For all we know, in another hour it might have been more.
I say they made all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>This ship and her crew received a message from a location they could
not hope to reach in under four hours. Just barely over three hours
later, they arrived at Titanic’s last known coordinates. Half an hour
after that, at 4am, they would finally locate the first of the
lifeboats. it would take until 8:30 in the morning for the last survivor
to be brought onboard. Passengers from Carpathia universally gave up
their berths, staterooms, and clothing to the rescuees, assisting the
crew at every turn and sitting with the sobbing survivors to offer
whatever comfort they could.</p>
<p>In total, seven hundred and five people of Titanic’s original two
thousand, two hundred and eight were brought onto Carpathia alive. No
other ship found survivors.</p>
<p>At 12:20am on April 15th, 1912, there was a miracle on the North
Atlantic. And it happened because a group of humans, some of them
strangers, many of them only passengers on a small and unimpressive
steam liner, looked at each other and decided: I cannot live with myself
if I do anything less.</p>
<p>The least we can do is remember them for it.</p>
