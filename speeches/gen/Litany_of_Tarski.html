<h2 id="by-alfred-tarski">By Alfred Tarski (?)</h2>
<p>This is not a specific speach. It is anything of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If X, I desire to believe X.</p>
<p>If NOT X, I desire to believe that NOT X.</p>
<p>Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When used at solstice, usually it is recited several times, beginning
with innocuous Xs like “The sky is blue” or “The earth is a sphere” and
working up to “I should abandon my plans” or “We are all going to die”.
There can also be a metalitany, where X is “reciting the Litany of
Tarski is helpful”. The metalitany can be recited in a modified
form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If reciting this litany is helpful, I desire to recite this
litany.</p>
<p>If reciting this litany is not helpful, I desire not to recite this
litany.</p>
<p>Let me not become attached to habits I may not want.</p>
