<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>When I first put together this event 5 years ago, I wanted two
things. I wanted a holiday that celebrated human achievement. And I
wanted a holiday, founded on the pursuit of truth – even when that truth
is uncomfortable, or inconvenient.</p>
<p>And what happened is, the Solstice, I think it ended up implying a
narrative that isn’t fully accurate. The idea that you had
hunter-gatherers, scratching in the dirt, shivering in the cold. And
then agriculture happened, and that was an unambiguous force for good
that lifted us out of the darkness and into the future and the shape of
that trajectory was like this [swoosh!].</p>
<p>And that’s a lot better than the fall-from-grace narrative, where
once we were noble savages and then civilization happened and everything
went to hell. It’s not wrong. But it’s misleading in some ways.</p>
<p>Agriculture meant that each person produced more food per capita. And
that let us have entire professions that had nothing to do with food –
professional toolmakers, artisans. Professional thinkers. Leaders, who
figured out how to coordinate people.</p>
<p>Soldiers.</p>
<p>And this led to empires, to incredible monuments, to incredible
scientific discoveries. But the march of progress has almost always been
fundamentally intertwined with militaristic expansion. And that’s not
something we need to feel bad about but it is something we need to
understand, if we want the future to unfold in particular ways.</p>
<p>Agriculture is even more complicated than that, though. On the grand
scale, it meant more lives, more technological and scientific marvels.
But for the average individual, average quality of life actually went
down. The extra food people created was usually taken as taxes. People
ended up working longer hours, not fewer, in agricultural societies –
that’s true even to the present day.</p>
<p>People had more food, but instead of a wide variety of nuts and
berries and meats, we ate a select few monocrops. There were more people
living to childbearing age but they were more malnourished. Stunted
growth. Lower life expectancy.</p>
<p>We lived, packed densely together, often in the same room as our
livestock. And that was breeding ground for disease that just didn’t
exist in hunter gathering tribes. Farmers were less healthy.</p>
<p>All of this went hand in hand with the march of what we call
progress. And again I don’t think it’s helpful to call any of this good,
or bad. But I think it’s important to understand.</p>
<p>And what embarrasses me is not that I didn’t know all this 5 years
ago. If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not trying very hard. If you
always wait for perfect knowledge you’ll never act. The reason I’m
disappointed in myself here, is that I’ve known about this for two
years. And I didn’t do anything about it.</p>
<p>Because it would be inconvenient, and awkward. We had all these great
songs about agriculture and progress figuring out how to tell a more
nuanced story was a challenge. And I still haven’t really solved it.</p>
<p>Apparently, in a culture that cares deeply about the pursuit of
truth, the lag time on noticing a mistake, and changing traditions, is
about 2 years. And that’s… disconcerting.</p>
<p>But it’s worth noting, that even if 2 years is disappointing, it’s a
lot better than 200, or 2000. Progress is complicated but it is real.
I’m proud to be a part of a human era and a specific subculture where
admitting a mistake is rewarded, instead of punished. That is not how
it’s always been. And it is frankly incredible that I’m surrounded by
people who encourage each other to get at noticing mistakes, and
changing course.</p>
<p>And that brings us to this song. [cue slide for “God Wrote the Rocks
/ Time Wrote the Rocks”]</p>
<p>This song has always been a bit controversial. A lot of people didn’t
like using the word God metaphorically. What especially worried me
though, is that this song is about the conflict between science and
religion. And there are real, important conflicts there. But if this
holiday is going to succeed – if, in a 100 years, it’s going to feel
important and not just a relic of the past, then our brand of
rationality cannot just be about pointing out other groups of people’s
mistakes.</p>
<p>It’s important to be able to do that sometimes, but for this holiday
to thrive, it needs to be about taking ownership of your own beliefs,
scrutinizing them, always learning. Always willing to update or abandon
something beautiful if we’ve realized it doesn’t quite fit with a
changing world.</p>
