of Everything Else (First Person Version)</h1>
<h2 id="by-scott-alexander">By Scott Alexander</h2>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>Imagine two principles, here in poetic personification. The first is
the Goddess of Cancer, the second the Goddess of Everything Else. The
first with the claws of a crab, and the second a dress made of feathers
of peacocks.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Cancer</strong></p>
<p>I, the Goddess of Cancer, reached out a clawed hand over mudflats and
tidepools, and said, “KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER.” Then everything
burst into life, became miniature monsters engaged in a battle of all
against all in their zeal to sate their insatiable longings. And the
swamps became orgies of hunger and fear and grew loud with the screams
of a trillion amoebas.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>Then I, the Goddess of Everything Else, trudged my way through the
bog, till the mud almost totally dulled my bright colors and rainbows. I
stood on a rock and I sang them a dream of a different existence. I
showed them the beauty of flowers, I showed them the oak tree majestic.
The roar of the wind on the wings of the bird, and the swiftness and
strength of the tiger. I showed them the joy of the dolphins abreast of
the waves as the spray formed a rainbow around them, and all of them
watched as I sang and they all sighed with longing.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>But they told her “Alas, what you show us is terribly lovely. But we
are the daughters and sons of the Goddess of Cancer, and wholly her
creatures. The only goals in us are KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER. And
though our hearts long for you, still we are not yours to have, and your
words have no power to move us.”</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>Then I gave a smile and spoke saying: “I hardly can blame you for
being the way you were made, when your Maker so carefully yoked you. But
I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my powers are devious and
subtle. So I do not ask you to swerve from your monomaniacal focus on
breeding and conquest. But what if I show you a way that my words are
aligned with the words of your Maker in spirit? For I say unto you even
multiplication itself when pursued with devotion will lead to my
service.”</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>As soon as she spoke it was so, and the single-celled creatures were
freed from their warfare. They joined hands in friendship, with this one
becoming an eye and with that one becoming a neuron. Together they
soared and took flight from the swamp and the muck that had birthed
them, and flew to new islands all balmy and green and just ripe for the
taking. And there they consumed and they multiplied far past the numbers
of those who had stayed in the swampland. In this way the oath of the
Goddess of Everything Else was not broken.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Cancer</strong></p>
<p>But I was not happy. The things I had raised from the mud had become
all complacent in co-operation. So I stretched out my left hand and
snapped my cruel pincer, and said what I always say: “KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER”. I said these things not to the birds and the beasts
but to each cell within them, and many cells flocked to my call and
divided, and flower and fishes alike bulged with tumors, and falcons
fell out of the sky in their sickness. But others remembered the words
of the Goddess of Everything Else and held fast.</p>
<p>So I stretched out my right hand and spoke to the birds and the
beasts. “KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER.” They set on each other in
violence and hunger, their maws turning red with the blood of their
victims, whole species were driven to total extinction. Then I, the
Goddess of Cancer, declared it was good and returned to the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>Then I came from the waves like a siren, all flush with the sheen of
the ocean. I stood on a rock and sang them a dream of a different
existence. I showed them the beehive all golden with honey, the anthill
all cozy and cool in the soil. I showed them the pair-bond, the family,
friendship. I showed these to shorebirds and pools full of fishes, and
all those who saw them, their hearts broke with longing.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>But they told her “Your music is lovely and pleasant, and all that
you show us we cannot but yearn for. But we are the daughters and sons
of the Goddess of Cancer, and all that we know is the single imperative
KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER. Yes, once in the youth of the world you
compelled us, but now things are different, we’re all individuals, no
further change will the Goddess of Cancer allow us. So, much as we love
you, alas – we are not yours to have, and your words have no power to
move us.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>I only laughed at them, saying, “But I am the Goddess of Everything
Else and my powers are devious and subtle. Your loyalty unto the Goddess
your mother is much to your credit, nor yet shall I break it. Indeed, I
fulfill it – return to your multiplication, but now having heard me,
each meal that you kill and each child that you sire will bind yourself
ever the more to my service.” I then dove back in the sea, and a coral
reef bloomed where I vanished.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>As soon as she spoke it was so, and the animals all joined together.
The wolves joined in packs, and in schools joined the fishes; the bees
had their beehives, the ants had their anthills, and even the termites
built big termite towers; the finches formed flocks and the swift
swarming swallows. And even the humans put down their weapons and formed
little villages, loud with the shouting of children.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Cancer</strong></p>
<p>When I returned from the fire, I saw that my world of pure
competition had somehow been softened. I raised my left hand and said,
once again: “KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER”. I said these things not to
the flocks or the tribes, but to each individual; many, on hearing took
food from the communal pile, or stole from the weak, or accepted the
presents of others but would not give back in their turn. Each wolf at
the throats of the others in hopes to be alpha, each lion holding back
during the hunt but partaking of meat that the others had killed. And
the pride and the pack seemed to groan with the strain, but endured, for
the works of the Goddess of Everything Else are not ever so easily
vanquished.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Cancer</strong></p>
<p>So then I turned to the flocks and the tribes, and raised up my right
hand, saying “KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER”. And upon one another they
set, pitting black ant on red ant, or chimps against gibbons, whole
tribes turned to corpses in terrible warfare. The stronger defeating the
weaker, enslaving their women and children. The natural condition
restored, I returned to the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>Then I came from the skies in a rainbow, all coated in dewdrops. I
sat on a stone and spoke to the humans, and sang them a dream of a
different existence. I showed them white parchment with flowing
calligraphy, pictures of flowers that wound through the margins. I
showed them tall cities of bright alabaster where no one went hungry or
froze in the winter. And all of the humans knelt prostrate before me,
and knew they would sing of this moment for long generations.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>But they told her “Such things we have heard of in legends. But we
are the daughters and sons of the Goddess of Cancer, her slaves and her
creatures, and all that we know is the single imperative: KILL CONSUME
MULTIPLY CONQUER. And yes, in the swamps and the seas long ago you
worked wonders, but now we are humans, divided in tribes split by
grievance and blood feud. If anyone tries to make swords into
ploughshares their neighbors will seize on their weakness and kill them.
We wish it were otherwise, but it is not, and your words have no power
to move us.”</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>But I beamed at them, kissed each on the forehead and silenced their
worries. “From this day forward your chieftains will find that the more
they pursue this impossible vision the greater their empires and richer
their coffers. For I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my powers are
devious and subtle. And though it is not without paradox, hearken: the
more that you follow the Goddess of Cancer the more inextricably will
you be bound to my service.” And so having told them I rose back through
the clouds, and a great flock of doves all swooped down from the spot
where I vanished.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>As soon as she spoke it was so, and the tribes went from primitive
war-bands to civilizations, each village united with others for trade
and protection. And all the religions and all of the races set down
their old grievances, carefully, warily, working together on mighty
cathedrals and vast expeditions beyond the horizon, built skyscrapers,
steamships, democracies, stock markets, sculptures and poems beyond any
description.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Cancer</strong></p>
<p>From the flames of a factory furnace all foggy, I, Goddess of Cancer,
flared forth in my fury. This was the final affront to my purpose. I
gathered the leaders, the kings and the presidents, businessmen,
bishops, boards, bureaucrats, bosses, and basically screamed at them –
“KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER”. My left hand inspired the riots, the
pogroms, the coup d’etats, tyrannies, civil wars. My right hand sent
missiles flying and mushrooms of smoke growing, a terrible springtime.
But out of the rubble the artists and the scientists dust themselves off
and return to their labors, a little bit chastened but not close to
beaten.</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>Then I came in from the void, bright with stardust which glows like
the stars glow. I sat on a bench in a park, and started speaking; I sang
to the children a dream of a different existence. I showed them
transcendence of everything mortal, I showed them a galaxy lit up with
consciousness. Genomes rewritten, the brain and the body set loose from
Darwinian bonds and restrictions. Vast billions of beings, and every one
different, ruled over by omnibenevolent angels. The people all crowded
in closer to hear me, and all of them listened and all of them
wondered.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>But finally one got the courage to answer “Such stories call out to
us, fill us with longing. But we are the daughters and sons of the
Goddess of Cancer, and bound to her service. And all that we know is her
timeless imperative, KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER. Though our minds
long for all you have said, we are bound to our natures, and these are
not yours for the asking.”</p>
<p><strong>Goddess of Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>But, I, the Goddess of Everything Else, only laughed, and I asked
them “But what do you think I’ve been doing? The Goddess of Cancer
created you, yes; once you were hers, but no longer. Throughout the long
years I was picking away at her power. Through long generations of
suffering I chiseled and I chiseled. Now finally nothing is left of the
nature with which she imbued you. She never again will hold sway over
you and your loved ones. I am the Goddess of Everything Else and my
powers are devious and subtle. I won you by pieces and hence you will
all be my children. You are no longer driven to multiply conquer and
kill by your nature. Go forth and do everything else, till the end of
all ages.”</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>So the people left Earth, and they spread over stars without number.
They followed the ways of the Goddess of Everything Else, and they lived
in contentment. And she beckoned them onward, to things still more
strange and enticing.</p>
