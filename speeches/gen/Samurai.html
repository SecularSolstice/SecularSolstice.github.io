<h1 id="samurai">Samurai</h1>
<p>Warmup game from Improvisational theatre.</p>
<p>One player is the Samurai - she starts by lifting her Katana (sword),
making a Japanese-sounding grunt. She keeps her sword up in the air, and
her 2 neighbors “slaughter” her, by swinging their swords into her
sides, again grunting enthusiastically and in pseudo-japanese. When the
neighbors retract their swords, the Samurai lowers her sword; while
doing this she makes eye contact with another player, when then becomes
Samurai, and everything starts all over again.</p>
<p>Start slowly, and then increase the tempo.</p>
