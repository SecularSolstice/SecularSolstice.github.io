<p>My grandfather died a few years ago.</p>
<p>His passing was not unexpected, and not dramatic. Gradually worsening
circulatory issues had plagued him for years. He’d had a Do Not
Resuscitate order for a while, and while he was walking under his own
power the month before, he’d been quietly making sure everything was in
order for what felt like a long time.</p>
<p>There are two things I want to tell you about him tonight, about what
kind of person he was.</p>
<p>Here’s one. My father was, as far as we can tell, the last person to
have a conversation with my grandfather. Grandpa had been in bed,
receiving gentle assistance breathing and turning himself for at least a
couple of days, when my dad walked in to sit with him a while. The first
thing Grandpa said when dad entered was “How can I help you?”</p>
<p>When my father related this to the rest of the family, none of us
were at all surprised. We had all heard those words countless times from
him. The first thing he would do when meeting someone new was to see how
he could make things better, and the most important question he would
have after seeing an old acquaintance was to find out if they could use
a hand.</p>
<p>Here’s the other. My grandfather was a devout Christian, and
sincerely believed in the rapture. There would come a day when the son
of God would come again, and the work of the world would be ended. We
talked about the bible a lot- not so much that I wouldn’t love to talk
with him again, on that or any subject- and towards the end of his life
the rapture came up more often. Even when I was a child though, I always
got the impression that he believed it would come in his lifetime. This
wasn’t something he thought might happen eventually, or a metaphor, but
something he expected to see with his own eyes.</p>
<p>I wondered what that would be like, each year it didn’t happen being
some small evidence that it wouldn’t happen, but not enough to shake
ones faith that it would. Then again, I did sometimes sit with him and
watch the news, and listened as he pointed out the mounting evidence
that the end of the world was growing sooner, not less likely. Maybe, at
the end, he thought he would see it if he just held on for another
day.</p>
<p>Another hour.</p>
<p>Five more minutes?</p>
<p>Since we’re all standing here, I guess you know it didn’t come in
time.</p>
<p>So uh, I can’t help but draw a connection here. I’m increasingly sure
Artificial Intelligence is going to wind up eating the world at some
point, that the child of mankind is going to be some strange arrangement
of math and electrons which will remake the world into something I might
not recognize. I don’t watch the news, but recent announcements and
research papers make me think the end of the world is growing sooner,
not less likely. I do expect to see this in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Here’s something I learned from Grandpa. This is how to wait for the
end of the world; you look people in the eye, and you ask</p>
<p>“How can I help?”</p>
