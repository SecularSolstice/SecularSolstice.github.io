<h1 id="the-virtue-of-ash">The Virtue of Ash</h1>
<h2 id="by-cody-wild">by Cody Wild</h2>
<p>Winter Solstice is a time of darkness.</p>
<p>We take time to consider the virtue of darkness: the strength and
honesty to face what is dark, and hard, and true. The virtue of darkness
is the willingness to stare into challenges so immense they seem
unsolvable, and not look away.</p>
<p>Solstice also meditates on the virtue of fire. The virtue of fire is
ambition, and problem solving, and a potent desire to do something to
fight back against the dark and the cold. It is gathering together to
tell stories of the beautiful futures we see flickering in the flames;
it is electricity and rockets and the dream of a different
existence..</p>
<p>Both of these metaphors, these virtues, are worthy ones, and I’m glad
our community takes the time to honor and reinforce them. But I want to
consider another virtue now: the virtue of ash.</p>
<hr />
<p>To do that, I want to tell you a story.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago this winter, the first World War came to a close.
Armistice was signed on November 11, and soldiers began to come home.
For those who had lived through the war, the winter of 1918 must have
been a time of mingled joy and horror. Joy, because the grinding engine
of death had finally slowed to a stop. Horror, because in so short a
time, so much had fallen apart. In France, nearly one in twenty people
died during the war. A third of the soldiers under 25 never made back it
to their families, in that winter of 1918.</p>
<p>Holidays are when we pull out songs and ornaments and tradition, and
they have a way of bridging you more closely to past winters. I can’t
imagine pulling out a photo from just five years ago, and reflecting on
all the stories that had brutally ended in the time since it was taken.
On all the ties of love and friendship turned to frayed ends, painful
with the ache of old laughter. On all the certainties of a boring,
middle class life now collapsed into unpredictability and madness. A
famous quote, from 1914, goes “the lamps are going out, all over Europe,
and they won’t be lit again in our lifetime”. I can’t imagine
remembering a once-glowing place, now turned to ash and tears.</p>
<p>I used to believe that I was born at the end of history. Not in some
direct way, not in those words, not consciously, but the world felt like
it was angled upward. It felt like chaos and conflict were relics of
history books. I didn’t grow up learning to hide under desks from the
bomb. The world didn’t feel caught up anymore in the grand narratives of
hatred and bloodshed that had dominated the past. Reasonableness and
progress were the order of the day. and I thought my life would be woven
into this story of boring, banal forward motion, that I had escaped the
reach of that big, all-consuming fear that your world may fall apart at
any moment.</p>
<p>Recently, that certainty has been shaken. I’ve watched the
reasonableness of our leaders devolve into viciousness, watched
suspicion and fear and short-termism diffuse into our international
system, watched the institutions built to ward off the next war grow
slowly less sturdy. I’ve watched old patterns start to repeat
themselves. I understand I may be over-reacting, but that doesn’t make
the fear less real to me. The fear that maybe our 75 years of peace, and
cooperation, and economic progress were the exception rather than the
rule. That, ultimately, humanity isn’t capable of overcoming our most
self-destructive tendencies. Even considering the possibility is
paralyzing, because the story I grew up with - the story that we were
past all that, and on to better things - has no room for a war like that
to be anything other than a repudiation of all the progress we thought
we’d won.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stories we all tell ourselves at Solstice are often ones of
figurative battle. We face dangers and challenges, we say, but if we can
prove ourselves equal to them, a better future lies ahead. Exploration
among the stars; mastery of our basic needs; a humanity freed from
illness and even death. In these stories, there is either success or
failure, because the stakes we imagine are so high. It’s not worth
imagining What Happens After, because we’ve told ourselves the only
catastrophes worth caring about are the ones without an After.</p>
<p>But I don’t think that’s nuanced enough. Because, yes, it can be true
that the consequences of failure are so enormous that just resigning
ourselves to living through them is unconscionable. And yet. The scope
of humanity’s possible futures isn’t constrained to either total
collapse or continuation along this endless upward curve.</p>
<p>Our community has stories to lead us towards utopia, and stories to
warn against apocalypse, but I don’t think it has enough stories of how
to mourn failure and loss, because we have a hard time imagining
failures that are less than total.</p>
<p>We need to be more imaginative.</p>
<p>We need to imagine the wake of a war, when ports and libraries and
the ambitious projects of good people lie in rubble. We need to imagine
an epidemic on a grand scale, that breaks our medical systems to
decimate communities and countries. We need to imagine these things, not
to glut ourselves on horror, but to practice the resolve of realizing
that something beautiful has been lost, that our dreams are now farther
and harder than once they were, and still setting our gaze to the path
forward.</p>
<p>It’s the virtue of looking at the burnt ruins of a house you spent
years building, of feeling sick with the weight of what was lost, and
beginning to rebuild, because what else is there to do but rebuild.
Because where else is there to go, but back up the mountain, pushing
yourself and your dreams higher once again.</p>
<p>That is the virtue of ash.</p>
<p>It’s easy, intellectually, to say that so long as humans are left, we
haven’t truly lost. But it won’t feel that way in the moment, I think.
It will feel like a loss beyond words. Humanity has been there before,
in the dark ages reflecting on the lost glory of Rome, after the
devastation of the black plague, amid the corpses of the 20th century
wars. At each of those moments, even when the loss felt all-consuming,
our ancestors had an obligation to make the better future we now
inhabit, and if we experienced the lik , we too would be obligated to
face what is already so and fix our eyes on the path to tomorrow. But I
don’t know if stories of fire and stories of darkness would be enough
nourishment at a time like that.</p>
<p>Because, even on small silly human scales, I know from experience
that it can tear you apart to see old happiness fade, to see
expectations collapse, and to have to start again. And if our only
alternative narrative to the permanent upward push of progress is the
conviction that we had our shot… and lost it, we abandon too many paths
of the future to darkness and despair.</p>
<p>This may sound too much like resignation to some of you; you may
believe that imagining the aftermath of catastrophe as anything other
than unthinkable, infinite darkness, is a too-dangerous concession. But
I don’t think resolve needs to bring resignation with it. I think you
can fight as hard as you can to prevent something, but still acknowledge
that if there are humans left in the rubble, those humans will need
stories that tell them all is not lost, even though much has been.</p>
<p>Survival is one thing, but survival of optimism is another. If my
world came apart at the seams, I don’t know what story I’d tell myself
to make the possibilities of the future feel more salient than the
reality of what was lost . Rather than seeing today as the starting
point for tomorrow, I fear I’d be be paralyzed by the ache of effort
squandered and hopes extinguished. I fear I’d be mesmerized by the
glittering lights of that house as it was in my memory as I stare at its
ashes on the ground. I fear that the shadows of what Was would haunt my
ability to think of What Can Be.</p>
<p>I wish us all nothing but light. I hope that the fires we build blaze
far into the future, and illuminate the pathways to prosperity of and
beyond our dreams. I hope that the losses you and we face are mild and
surmountable.</p>
<p>But if all of those hopes fail, I wish you the virtue of ash, to help
turn your eyes upward and begin anew.</p>
