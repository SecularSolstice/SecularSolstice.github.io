<h1 id="atoms-with-consciousness-matter-with-curiousity">Atoms with
Consciousness, Matter with Curiousity</h1>
<h2 id="by-richard-feynman">By Richard Feynman</h2>
<p>There are the rushing waves<br />
mountains of molecules<br />
each stupidly minding its own business<br />
trillions apart<br />
yet forming white surf in unison</p>
<p>Ages on ages<br />
before any eyes could see<br />
year after year<br />
thunderously pounding the shore as now.<br />
For whom, for what?<br />
On a dead planet<br />
with no life to entertain.</p>
<p>Never at rest<br />
tortured by energy<br />
wasted prodigiously by the Sun<br />
poured into space.<br />
A mite makes the sea roar.</p>
<p>Deep in the sea<br />
all molecules repeat<br />
the patterns of one another<br />
till complex new ones are formed.<br />
They make others like themselves<br />
and a new dance starts.<br />
Growing in size and complexity<br />
living things<br />
masses of atoms<br />
DNA, protein<br />
dancing a pattern ever more intricate.</p>
<p>Out of the cradle<br />
onto dry land<br />
here it is<br />
standing:<br />
atoms with consciousness;<br />
matter with curiosity.</p>
<p>Stands at the sea,<br />
wonders at wondering: I<br />
a universe of atoms<br />
an atom in the Universe.</p>
