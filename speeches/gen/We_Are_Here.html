<h2 id="by-daniel-speyer">By Daniel Speyer</h2>
<p>Is there someone out there to hear?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>And you are.</p>
<p>And I know that isn’t the answer some of you were hoping for. But
it’s true.</p>
<p>I told you before that tonight isn’t about blind hope, and it’s not.
But it is about hope. A brighter future can happen if people like us
make it possible.</p>
<p>And I know that there are people in this room working toward making
tomorrow dawn brighter, or to protecting the chance the it dawns at
all.</p>
<p>So if you are working directly toward one of those goals, whether in
science or art, politics or business – whatever field you have found to
be a lever fitted to your hand and long enough to nudge the world with –
then I ask you to rise and say that you are here.</p>
<p>And if you are working indirectly, by giving money, evaluating
levers, administering, inspiring – whatever the means – I ask you also
to rise and say that you are here.</p>
<p>If you want to do something, or hope to do something, but it will
have to wait until you find the right lever, or until you grow stronger,
(and I fully expect that everyone in this room will grow stronger), then
please rise and say that you are here.</p>
<p>If you are prepared to be a friend to someone who is doing something,
please rise and say that you are here.</p>
<p>If anyone is still seated, please rise.</p>
