<h2 id="by-daniel-speyer">By Daniel Speyer</h2>
<p>Is there someone out there to hear?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>And you are.</p>
<p>And I know that isn’t the answer some of you were hoping for. But it’s true.</p>
<p>I told you before that tonight isn’t about blind hope, and it’s not. But it is about hope. A brighter future can happen if people like us make it possible.</p>
<p>And I know that there are people in this room working toward making tomorrow dawn brighter, or to protecting the chance the it dawns at all.</p>
<p>So if you are working directly toward one of those goals, whether in science or art, politics or business – whatever field you have found to be a lever fitted to your hand and long enough to nudge the world with – then I ask you to rise and say that you are here.</p>
<p>And if you are working indirectly, by giving money, evaluating levers, administering, inspiring – whatever the means – I ask you also to rise and say that you are here.</p>
<p>If you want to do something, or hope to do something, but it will have to wait until you find the right lever, or until you grow stronger, (and I fully expect that everyone in this room will grow stronger), then please rise and say that you are here.</p>
<p>If you are prepared to be a friend to someone who is doing something, please rise and say that you are here.</p>
<p>If anyone is still seated, please rise.</p>
