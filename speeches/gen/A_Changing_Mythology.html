<h1 id="a-changing-mythology">A Changing Mythology</h1>
<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>Smallpox has a kind of mythological vibe to it. It’s this ancient
disease that’s been with us since before we even had writing to record
the names of the victims. It killed in ancient Egypt. India. China. And
then after thousands of years we band together, we find the tools to
defeat and it we rid the world of our ancient enemy once and for
all.</p>
<p>It’s a story I’ve drawn a lot of strength from - it reminds me what
humanity is capable of.</p>
<p>The problem with mythology, though, is that sometimes it turns out
not to be true. And three days ago, I learned that nine days ago, some
new genetic evidence came out suggesting Smallpox may only be 500 years
old, instead of 12,000.</p>
<p>Now, I’m a guy who cares a <em>lot</em> about evidence and critical
thinking. I’ve spent the past 5 years training myself not to flinch or
make excuses when I find new evidence that contradicts my favorite
stories. But even today, there’s a part of me that’s like… “REALLY
science? Really? Three days? Three days before Solstice and you gotta go
change reality and make me rewrite all my speeches?”</p>
<p>And the thing to remember is that <em>reality</em> didn’t change.
Reality is exactly the same way it’s always been. The only thing that’s
changed is my state of ignorance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Solstice is about a new kind of mythology</p>
