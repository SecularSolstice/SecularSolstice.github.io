<p>She looked over his shoulder<br />
For vines and olive trees,<br />
Marble well-governed cities<br />
And ships upon untamed seas,<br />
But there on the shining metal<br />
His hands had put instead<br />
An artificial wilderness<br />
And a sky like lead.</p>
<p>A plain without a feature, bare and brown,<br />
No blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood,<br />
Nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down,<br />
Yet, congregated on its blankness, stood<br />
An unintelligible multitude,<br />
A million eyes, a million boots in line,<br />
Without expression, waiting for a sign.</p>
<p>Out of the air a voice without a face<br />
Proved by statistics that some cause was just<br />
In tones as dry and level as the place:<br />
No one was cheered and nothing was discussed;<br />
Column by column in a cloud of dust<br />
They marched away enduring a belief<br />
Whose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief.</p>
<p>She looked over his shoulder<br />
For ritual pieties,<br />
White flower-garlanded heifers,<br />
Libation and sacrifice,<br />
But there on the shining metal<br />
Where the altar should have been,<br />
She saw by his flickering forge-light<br />
Quite another scene.</p>
<p>Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot<br />
Where bored officials lounged (one cracked a joke)<br />
And sentries sweated for the day was hot:<br />
A crowd of ordinary decent folk<br />
Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke<br />
As three pale figures were led forth and bound<br />
To three posts driven upright in the ground.</p>
<p>The mass and majesty of this world, all<br />
That carries weight and always weighs the same<br />
Lay in the hands of others; they were small<br />
And could not hope for help and no help came:<br />
What their foes like to do was done, their shame<br />
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride<br />
And died as men before their bodies died.</p>
<p>She looked over his shoulder<br />
For athletes at their games,<br />
Men and women in a dance<br />
Moving their sweet limbs<br />
Quick, quick, to music,<br />
But there on the shining shield<br />
His hands had set no dancing-floor<br />
But a weed-choked field.</p>
<p>A ragged urchin, aimless and alone,<br />
Loitered about that vacancy; a bird<br />
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:<br />
That girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,<br />
Were axioms to him, whoâ€™d never heard<br />
Of any world where promises were kept,<br />
Or one could weep because another wept.</p>
<p>The thin-lipped armorer,<br />
Hephaestos, hobbled away,<br />
Thetis of the shining breasts<br />
Cried out in dismay<br />
At what the god had wrought<br />
To please her son, the strong<br />
Iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles<br />
Who would not live long.</p>
