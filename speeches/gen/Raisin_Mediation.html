<p><em>[Should be performed with an actual raisin]</em></p>
<p>Holding: First, take a raisin and hold it in the palm of your hand or
between your finger and thumb.</p>
<p>Seeing: Take time to really focus on it; gaze at the raisin with care
and full attention—imagine that you’ve just dropped in from Mars and
have never seen an object like this before in your life. Let your eyes
explore every part of it, examining the highlights where the light
shines, the darker hollows, the folds and ridges, and any asymmetries or
unique features.</p>
<p>Touching: Turn the raisin over between your fingers, exploring its
texture. Maybe do this with your eyes closed if that enhances your sense
of touch.</p>
<p>Smelling: Hold the raisin beneath your nose. With each inhalation,
take in any smell, aroma, or fragrance that may arise. As you do this,
notice anything interesting that may be happening in your mouth or
stomach.</p>
<p>Placing: Now slowly bring the raisin up to your lips, noticing how
your hand and arm know exactly how and where to position it. Gently
place the raisin in your mouth; without chewing, noticing how it gets
into your mouth in the first place. Spend a few moments focusing on the
sensations of having it in your mouth, exploring it with your
tongue.</p>
<p>Tasting: When you are ready, prepare to chew the raisin, noticing how
and where it needs to be for chewing. Then, very consciously, take one
or two bites into it and notice what happens in the aftermath,
experiencing any waves of taste that emanate from it as you continue
chewing. Without swallowing yet, notice the bare sensations of taste and
texture in your mouth and how these may change over time, moment by
moment. Also pay attention to any changes in the object itself.</p>
<p>Swallowing: When you feel ready to swallow the raisin, see if you can
first detect the intention to swallow as it comes up, so that even this
is experienced consciously before you actually swallow the raisin.</p>
<p>Following: Finally, see if you can feel what is left of the raisin
moving down into your stomach, and sense how your body as a whole is
feeling after you have completed this exercise.</p>
