<p>Affect is a funny thing. It has a tendency to spread from initial
causes - and that spread can be induced.</p>
<p>There is a meditative practice called metta meditation - this is also
known as loving kindness meditation. The bright, shining feelings of
love you have for those closest to you can flare outwards. You can nurse
a candle of love and goodwill, and turn it into a bright flame of
kindness. The positive affect for someone you love can grow to encompass
all life.</p>
<p>The practice is actually fairly simple. I want you to think of
someone important to you. Someone you love deeply…someone who you feel
better for having known. It could be a family member, a partner, a
mentor. Someone who brings out the best in you. I want you to think
vividly about them - in fact, write their name down, and hold that paper
during this exercise.</p>
<p>What you’re going to do is think to yourself the following things
-</p>
<p>I want this person to be safe<br />
I want this person to be happy<br />
I want this person to be healthy<br />
I want this person to be at peace in the world.</p>
<p>You’ll be doing that a few times, to really generate that feeling of
love, kindness, the warmth this person brings you</p>
<p>Now, I want you to think of someone you’re indifferent to, like maybe
a cashier at a place you frequent, or neighbor you’ve never introduced
yourself to.</p>
<p>Focus on the feeling you got from the person you love…extend that to
this person you are indifferent to, and continue the mantra</p>
<p>I want this person to be safe<br />
I want this person to be happy<br />
I want this person to be healthy<br />
I want this person to be at peace in the world.</p>
<p>Now, we come to the tricky part. I want you to think about someone
you dislike. Maybe your boss, or the dude who cut you off the other day.
I don’t recommend starting with someone you truly loathe, it can inhibit
the activity.</p>
<p>As before, focus on that feeling of love, the kindness you already
grew to encompass someone you are indifferent to, extending it further
to this person you dislike. It’s ok if it’s difficult - but please try
your best….focus on the warmth</p>
<p>I want this person to be safe<br />
I want this person to be happy<br />
I want this person to be healthy<br />
I want this person to be at peace in the world.</p>
<p>And now, for the last part, I want you to think back on the person
you love, and then about this space…then maybe Boston…Massachusetts…the
USA…zooming out to the whole world. Let that feeling grow, to encompass
every human being that ever existed and ever will exist. And focus on
the mantra</p>
<p>I want everyone to be safe<br />
I want everyone to be happy<br />
I want everyone to be healthy<br />
I want everyone to be at peace in the world.</p>
<p>We will continue in silence for 5 minutes, continuing this mantra,
letting love and kindness fill ourselves, this space, and the world.
Every human is worth loving. Every human is worth kindness. And no human
should ever face darkness.</p>
<p>As an aside, you should keep that paper with the name of your loved
one on it - it will make for a good focus and a good reminder of this
experience.</p>
