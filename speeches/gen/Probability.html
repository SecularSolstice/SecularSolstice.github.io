<p>Our community is ambitious. We aim to do big things, to solve adult
problems.</p>
<p>Four years ago, in New York City, in a ceremony much like this one,
Ray Arnold, the creator of Secular Solstice, spoke about this. He
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have people in this room, right now, who are working on fixing big
problems in the medical industry. We have people in this room who are
trying to understand and help fix the criminal justice system. We have
people in this room who are dedicating their lives to eradicating global
poverty. We have people in this room who are literally working to set in
motion plans to optimize everything ever. We have people in this room
who are working to make sure that the human race doesn’t destroy itself
before we have a chance to become the people we really want to be.</p>
<p>And while they aren’t in this room, there are people we know who
would be here if they could, who are doing their part to try and solve
this whole death problem once and for all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I don’t know whether and how well any of us are going to succeed
at any of these things, but…</p>
<p>God damn, people. You people are amazing, and even if only one of you
made a dent in some of the problems you’re working on, that… that would
just be incredible.</p>
<p>Indeed it would. It would be incredible. And I believe that the same
is true of the people in this room today, four years later. We recognize
that these things matter, that they matter more than most of society
recognizes, more even than any of us can really visualize. The
utilitarian significance of even the least of those problems is easily
in the millions of lives.</p>
<p>But we are also a community of truth seekers. It’s not enough for the
stories we tell ourselves about what we’re going to accomplish to be
motivating; they have to be accurate. So, what should we expect when we
set out to change the world?</p>
<p>Large scale technological and other change in society tends to obey
power laws; a small minority of individual cases wind up having the vast
majority of the impact. Y Combinator, the most prestigious startup
accelerator in the world, has funded about a thousand startups; about
three-quarters of their returns have come from just two of these. Making
a big profit is a crude proxy for impact through a startup, but if we
run with it, that gives us a probability of 0.3%. And that’s one of the
higher-risk-higher-reward life paths available to someone today.</p>
<p>I didn’t have time to find more numbers, but as far as I know, they
basically all look roughly like this. According to a study by the
Financial Times [PDF], 40% of millennials think they’ll have a global
impact. In other words, almost 40% of millennials are extremely
miscalibrated.</p>
<p>So we see that truly changing the world is a rare event. But that,
too, is part of the standard story; because it’s rare, you’ll have to
work very hard and be very resourceful to pull it off. But you can still
do it if you try, right?</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that our brains tell us because of
availability bias. As Bruce Schneier put it: “We tend to exaggerate [the
probability of] spectacular, strange and rare events, and downplay
ordinary, familiar and common ones.” He was talking about things like
terrorist attacks, but it’s just as true of things like making a major
scientific breakthrough. “Stories engage us at a much more visceral
level [than data], especially stories that are vivid, exciting or
personally involving.”</p>
<p>In Terry Pratchett’s Discworld, “million-to-one chances crop up nine
times out of ten”. It’s not any different from other fiction in this
regard; it’s just more honest. Nonfiction isn’t much better because of
selection bias; you hear about the guy who won the Nobel, and not about
the hundreds of thousands of others who set out to win it and
failed.</p>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky summed up the problem in “A Technical Explanation
of Technical Explanations”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember Spock from Star Trek? Spock often says something along the
lines of, “Captain, if you steer the Enterprise directly into a black
hole, our probability of survival is only 2.837%.” Yet nine times out of
ten the Enterprise is not destroyed. The people who write this stuff
have no idea what scientists mean by “probability”. They suppose that a
probability of 99.9% is something like feeling really sure. They suppose
that Spock’s statement expresses the challenge of successfully steering
the Enterprise through a black hole, like a video game rated five stars
for difficulty. What we mean by “probability” is that if you utter the
words “two percent probability” on fifty independent occasions, it
better not happen more than once.</p>
<p>(At least, not in the limit.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are fewer than fifty of us in this room, and the probability of
an individual achieving the kinds of ambitions we’re talking about here
is probably lower than two percent.</p>
<p>So that’s the problem: if you want to change the world, the outside
view says it’s probably going to be all for nothing. Any attempt to do
so in a way that avoids that problem is unlikely to have a large
individual impact.</p>
<p>This problem is so omnipresent in any attempt to do something big
that it’s common to just ignore it as background noise. We shouldn’t. We
seek the truth because avoiding it inevitably leads to failure when
dealing with hard problems. If we’re serious about solving them, we have
to face this harsh reality head-on.</p>
<p>So what do we do about it?</p>
<p>One option is to give up, and stick to easy things that are likely to
work. You can optimize for your own happiness pretty well that way. But
this is no solution at all; we have to do the hard things because, as
the Comet King said, “Somebody has to and no one else will.” At least,
not on the margin.</p>
<p>Another option is unjustified optimism. This seems to be
unfortunately common in our community. Some higher-level rationalists
have implemented an advanced form of this where they make their monkey
brains believe one thing even as they know the truth to be something
else. This might work, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>A third option is to forcibly suppress your monkey brain’s
risk-aversion and submit yourself in obedience to the power laws: spend
your life doing the risky thing, knowing that it will probably all be
for naught, because it’s the right thing to do. If you’re working on
more incremental things like malaria nets, this can work out okay. You
can be like the man who throws the starfish back into the sea every day;
others may say it doesn’t matter because more will always wash up, but
it mattered to that one. If you’re aiming for something more
all-or-nothing, like getting AGI right, then this may be psychologically
harder.</p>
<p>But there’s one other option, and I think this is the one I like
best: Embrace the community.</p>
<p>This works because of two reasons. The first is that, when you’re in
a community of people with similar goals, you don’t have to do
everything yourself. You can clerk the office that handles the funding,
or host the convention that summons the family. You can be one of the
people who makes the future turn out okay, even if you’re not the
one-in-a-million who makes the scientific breakthrough that fixes
everything.</p>
<p>The second reason is that our community might actually be awesome
enough to beat the outside-view odds.</p>
<p>Four years ago, when Ray spoke those words, it didn’t necessarily
look that way. That was around the time I found the community online,
though I did not meet most of you until later. To be sure, some
interesting things had already happened by then, and maybe the future
will look back and see some of them as the beginning of the Great Change
(or maybe not). But in those past four years, I’ve been lucky enough to
watch us grow up, and start accumulating a track record of changing the
world in real ways.</p>
<p>We brought AI risk from a topic argued about by nerds on internet
forums to an issue taken seriously by the world’s foremost experts in
the relevant fields, by billionaire influencers like Bill Gates and Elon
Musk, and, as of last October, by the sitting President of the United
States.</p>
<p>We solved the problem of figuring out which charities actually work
for rescuing people from global poverty and moved hundreds of millions
of dollars to them, and that number’s only going to grow.</p>
<p>With help from allied coalitions, we got giant corporations to dump
the worst offenders of factory farming, banned confinement cages right
here in Massachusetts, and brought funding and attention to an industry
that has invented a hamburger that doesn’t come from a cow, not as some
futuristic fantasy but as something that you can eat today if you live
in the right city.</p>
<p>Not everything we’ve attempted has yet borne such undeniable fruit,
and we’ve had our share of failures. But I think we’ve earned the right
to call ourselves a community that’s capable of getting results, and I
think there’ll be more soon, including in areas we haven’t even thought
of yet.</p>
<p>The law of the universe is that you can’t beat the odds. But
conditional on the right things? Yeah, I think you can.</p>
