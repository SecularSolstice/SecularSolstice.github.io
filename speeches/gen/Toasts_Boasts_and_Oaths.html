<p>One person introduces 3 plush animals with a short story and then
shows how you can grab an animal to make a Toast, Boast or Oath:</p>
<ul>
<li>make an announcement/compliment to individuals or a group =
toast</li>
<li>“brag” about something you’ve accomplished = boast</li>
<li>commit to something = oath</li>
</ul>
<p>We are sitting in a circle and everyone is invited to contribute
toasts, boasts or oaths. This was done for a while, with the group
reacting encouragingly to contributions. The plushies can be available
for the rest of the weekend for spontaneous exclamations too.</p>
