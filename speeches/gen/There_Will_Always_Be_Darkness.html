Is Magic</h2>
<p>There will always be darkness in the world, but there will also
always be those who find the light! The Pillars knew this! That’s why
they created the Elements of Harmony! The Elements showed me and my
friends how strong our friendship could be! Together we worked to bring
harmony to Equestria! But there will always be more to do! Which is why
we teach others about the Magic of Friendship! Others who will continue
our mission after we are gone! Now I truly understand! The Elements were
just symbols! The real magic has always been right here! And the more
who understand how powerful friendship is, the stronger we will all be!
Together!”</p>
