<p>This activity is designed to help participants cope with loss. It requires each participant to have paper and a writing implement, and a fire or other place where paper can be burned.</p>
<p>Ask participants to write down something they have lost in the past year.</p>
<p>Then (this can happen at a later point in the program) ask each person to burn their piece of paper.</p>
<p>“It’s one thing to know that you’ve lost something. It’s another thing to actually feel like it’s lost. To understand that it’s never coming back. Now, we will take a step to making us really feel like what we’ve lost is gone. We will burn what we wrote down. We will burn what we lost.”</p>
