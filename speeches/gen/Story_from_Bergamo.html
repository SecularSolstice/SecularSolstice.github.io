<p>[Note: Some numbers in this post come from December 2020, and have
not been updated.]</p>
<p>It’s traditional, at this point in a Solstice program, to reflect on
the fact that the universe does not care about us, and sometimes, we
just… lose. At great cost.</p>
<p>This is a translation of a Facebook post, which you may have read
earlier in this year. It was written by a doctor in Italy, Dr. Daniele
Macchini, and translated by an epidemiologist in Switzerland, Silvia
Stringhini.</p>
<hr />
<p>“After much thought about whether and what to write about what is
happening to us, I felt that silence was not responsible. I will
therefore try to convey to people far from our reality what we are
living in Bergamo in these days of Covid-19 pandemic. I understand the
need not to create panic, but when the message of the dangerousness of
what is happening does not reach people I shudder.</p>
<p>I myself watched with some amazement the reorganization of the entire
hospital in the past week, when our current enemy was still in the
shadows: the wards slowly “emptied”, elective activities were
interrupted, intensive care was freed up to create as many beds as
possible. All this rapid transformation brought an atmosphere of silence
and surreal emptiness to the corridors of the hospital that we did not
yet understand, waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many
(including me) were not so sure would ever come with such ferocity.</p>
<p>I still remember my night call a week ago when I was waiting for the
results of a swab. When I think about it, my anxiety over one possible
case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I’ve seen what’s
happening.</p>
<p>Well, the situation now is dramatic to say the least. The war has
literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. But now
that need for beds has arrived in all its drama. One after the other the
departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace. The
boards with the names of the patients, of different colours depending on
the operating unit, are now all red and instead of surgery you see the
diagnosis, which is always the damned same: bilateral interstitial
pneumonia.</p>
<p>… And while there are still people who boast of not being afraid by
ignoring directions, protesting because their normal routine
is”temporarily” put in crisis, the epidemiological disaster is taking
place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are
only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this
tsunami that has overwhelmed us.</p>
<p>Cases are multiplying, we arrive at a rate of 15-20 admissions per
day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after
the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the E.R. is
collapsing.</p>
<p>Reasons for the access always the same: fever and breathing
difficulties, fever and cough, respiratory failure. Radiology reports
always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral
interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All to be
hospitalized. Someone already to be intubated and go to intensive care.
For others it’s too late… Every ventilator becomes like gold: those in
operating theatres that have now suspended their non-urgent activity
become intensive care places that did not exist before.</p>
<p>The staff is exhausted. I saw the tiredness on faces that didn’t know
what it was despite the already exhausting workloads they had. I saw a
solidarity of all of us, who never failed to go to our internist
colleagues to ask “what can I do for you now?”</p>
<p>Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies
instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can’t save
everyone, and the vital parameters of several patients at the same time
reveal an already marked destiny.</p>
<p>There are no more shifts, no more hours. Social life is suspended for
us. We no longer see our families for fear of infecting them. Some of us
have already become infected despite the protocols. Some of our
colleagues who are infected also have infected relatives and some of
their relatives are already struggling between life and death.</p>
<p>So be patient, you can’t go to the theatre, museums or the gym. Try
to have pity on the myriad of old people you could exterminate.</p>
<p>We just try to make ourselves useful. You should do the same: we
influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many
more. Please share this message. We must spread the word to prevent what
is happening here from happening all over Italy.”</p>

<p>This translation of Dr. Macchini’s post was posted by Dr. Stringhini
on March 9, 2020. Up to that date, in total, 464 people had died of
COVID-19 in Italy.</p>
<p>As of this week, that number has surpassed 65,000.</p>
