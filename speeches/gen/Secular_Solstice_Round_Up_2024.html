2024</h1>
<h2 id="by-daniel-speyer">by Daniel Speyer</h2>
<p>Secular Solstice is a holiday designed by and for rationalists. It
started as an attempt to match the sort of gatherings traditionally
religious people tend to have in wintertime, but without compromising on
truth.</p>
<p>Is it possible to create that same sense of emotional weight without
making stuff up to do it? And without the aid of a long tradition?
(Though this is the 14th year we’re doing it, so there’s some
tradition).</p>
<p>Empirically, yes.</p>
<p>Because the world is full of things that genuinely inspire awe.
Things entirely worth honoring and celebrating.</p>
<p>And the world is also full of things that genuinely inspire fear. We
can and should face them squarely, and together.</p>
<p>This is not a silly holiday. It is not Festivus. It is not Santa
Claus and Reindeer. We gather on the longest night of the year to stare
together straight into the deepest darkness and <em>make</em>
<em>it</em> <em>back</em> <em>down</em>.</p>
<p>What does it mean in practice? Lots of singing. Some speeches.
Sometimes other things. The whole thing runs a couple of hours.</p>
