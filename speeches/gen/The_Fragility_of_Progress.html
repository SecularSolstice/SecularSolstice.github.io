<h2 id="by-alex-altair">by Alex Altair</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 4th. You sit in a cafe, enjoying the morning
hours before you head to work.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a bank holiday; some family friends visited you in the
city. You took them to Madame Tussauds wax museum, and the little ones
wanted to see the science museum downtown. It was a cloudless day. Your
friends talked about how strange it was that your city life was
surrounded by people, and how did you manage to deal with them all? You
joked that mostly you ignored them like ducks walking along a pond. But
in your heart, each pair of shoes that walked past you was a kindling
soul, a well of potential ready to burst its light out into the world.
Every shuffling elder was a life well lived, and every boisterous child
was a force that would change the world.</p>
<p>The turning of the last century, during which you were a child, was a
symbol of the future that we had all collectively achieved. The
startling pace of change has left the world of your parents’ childhood
almost unrecognizable to you, as much as your grandparents’ world is
unrecognizable to your parents. There is no reason to think that the
pace of change will ever stop. To you, just freshly into adulthood,
continuous progress is a law of nature.</p>
<p>Your work centers around coordination. You help to lubricate trade
between countless other people, located in cities across the globe. You
trust your clients and they trust you, a long railway of trust that lies
founded on unprecedented international stability. The world is so big
and rich that it’s hard for any individual to change it; and this global
interdependence has furthered the economic incentive for cooperation.
The more we trust, the more we gain; so says the new law of nature.
Propelled by this fresh sense of meaning, you head to your office,
knowing that what you do matters.</p>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 5th. You walk into the cafe, and pick up the
paper. You sit down with your coffee and look at the headline.</p>
<p>“GREAT BRITAIN DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY”</p>
<p>You stare at the page. You read the words, but they meet with
resistance. Why? Over what? To what end? Sure, Germany has not exactly
been Britain’s ally, and every up-and-coming economy needs to do a bit
of posturing and teeth baring. But war? Like men running around with
bayonets and dueling in a field? It was an anachronism.</p>
<p>Never has your life been touched by a real war. There are always
conflicts abroad, somewhere in the world. But you don’t know anyone who
has died in a war. Your older brother didn’t serve. Your parents didn’t
serve. You don’t recall your grandparents talking about war. It’s been
decades. Maybe half a century. You’d have to look it up, that’s how long
it had been.</p>
<p>War was a tool we used before we had a sense of what the future could
become. Before the Renaissance, before the Enlightenment. We have better
ways, now.</p>
<p>You’ve heard that the idea called nationalism is all the rage these
days. Each patriot felt the same passion, only with a different subject
in their heart. Why couldn’t they see that one country being great did
not preclude other countries from also being great? Why can’t they see
that the working people in the north are natural allies to the working
people in the south? They put on different clothes, they breathe the
fresh scent of different forests, but they each love their families the
same, and the sun rises and sets on them all. Surely they can see that
it is their humanity that makes them great, and that same humanity that
unites us. Surely, they won’t march against their mirror image just for
the sake of nationalism.</p>
<p>You realize that your cousins will volunteer. They would not miss the
chance to defend the glory of Britain for anything. You hope to God that
they will be okay. You hope that the war will be short. You get up from
your table and head to work, because you do not know what else to
do.</p>
<p>It is August 5th, 1914, and the war will not be short.
_________________________________________</p>
<p>The First World War is considered to be the first truly modern war.
The technological products of humankind had improved so much since the
last major conflict that no one really knew what would happen after it
started. What happened was that on the very first day, thousands of men
died walking straight into the astoundingly effective fire of machine
guns. What happened was that 27,000 men died in a single day two weeks
later, akin to having 9/11 happen every hour from 9 in the morning to 5
in the evening. What happened was that the greatest nations of the world
spent the next four years draining each other of blood, taking 15
million human lives from the cradle of life.</p>
<p>The momentum of the early 20th century looks very similar to the
momentum of the 21st century. Replace planes, trains and automobiles
with smartphones and machine learning, and replace Einstein’s miracle
year with the discovery of the Higgs Boson and gravity waves.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite all this optimism, despite the works of the Goddess
of Everything Else, the momentum of progress was split into parts, the
allied powers and the central powers, and those parts were slammed
together, their economic prowess consuming each other, whittling down
the modern world until so many once-great countries were on the edge of
societal starvation.</p>
<p>The war ended, largely from mutual exhaustion, on November 11th,
1918, one hundred years ago. At the time it was called The Great War, or
sometimes the War to End All Wars. We do not know it by that name today,
because we did not learn our lessons in time.</p>
<p>The efforts of all people since have brought us back from the brink
of those two world wars, and the Goddess of Everything Else has worked
her ways once more. But her powers are devious and subtle, and we do not
know how the story continues. The outside view is our most powerful tool
for predicting the future, and yet trends are not laws. There is no
particular reason to think that another total war will come, and there
is no particular reason to think that the future is assured.</p>
