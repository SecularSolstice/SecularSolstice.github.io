<h2 id="by-james-babcock">By James Babcock</h2>
<p>The original Eldritch horrors, before Lovecraft, were fairies - the
fae. In stories, the morality of the Fae is amoral and capricious - not
black and white, but orange and gray. They aren’t chaotic–they follow
rules, just, rules that are unintuitive, not the sorts of rules humans
would normally follow. And if you squint a little, at the mythology of
ancient people defeating the Fae by understanding their rules, it
matches pretty well to slightly-less-ancient people defeating aspects of
physics by understanding its rules.</p>
<p>In myth, the Fae are vulnerable to iron and salt. The challenges of
physics were vulnerable to machines and iodization. In myth, the fae
cast strange curses which humans defeat with seemingly equally-arbitrary
rituals. We protect ourselves by wash our hands before we eat, and
injecting small amounts of diseases into our blood.</p>
<p>In myths, the Fae present problems that seem impossible. This song,
Scarborough Fair, presents such a series of seemingly-impossible
challenges:</p>
