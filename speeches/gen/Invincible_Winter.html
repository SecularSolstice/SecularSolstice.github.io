<p>Early September brought Seattle what were to be some of the hottest
days of the summer. For weeks, people had been turning on fans, escaping
to cooler places to spend the day, buying out air conditioners, which
most of the city didn’t own. I cowered in my room with an AC unit on
loan from a friend lodged in the window, only going out walking when the
sun had set.</p>
<p>That week, Eastern Washington was burning. It does that every summer.
But this year, a lot of Eastern Washington was burning. Say it with me –
2017 was one of the worst fire years on record. That week, the ash from
the fires drifted over Seattle. You smelled smoke everywhere in the
city. The sky was gray. At sunrise and sunset, the sun was blood-red.
One day, gray ash drifted down from the sky, the exact size of
snowflakes. It dusted the cars and kept falling through the
afternoon.</p>
<p>That day, people said the weather was downright apocalyptic. They
weren’t entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Many people aren’t clear on what exactly a nuclear winter is. The
mechanic is straightforward. When cities burn in the extreme heat of a
nuclear blast – and we do mean cities, plural, most nuclear exchange
scenarios involve multiple strikes for strategic reasons – they turn
into soot, and the soot floats up. If enough ash from burned cities
reaches the stratosphere, the upper layer of the atmosphere, it stays
there for a long time. The ash clouds blot out the sun, cool the earth,
and choke off the growth of crops. Within weeks, agriculture grinds to a
halt.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of uncertainty over nuclear winter. But by one
estimate, the detonation of less than 1% of the world’s nuclear arsenal
– a fairly small war – could drop the temperatures by five degrees
Celsius, and warm up slowly again over twenty years. The ozone layer
would thin. Less rain would fall. Two billion people would starve.</p>
<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday that week, the temperature was predicted to
reach over 100 degrees. It didn’t. The particulates in the air blocked
enough of the sun’s heat that it barely hit the 90’s. Pedestrians didn’t
quite breathe easier, but did sweat less. Our own tiny, toy model taste
of a nuclear apocalypse.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’d been feeling strange for the last few weeks, unrelatedly, and
sitting at my desk for hours, my mind did a lot of wandering. I hoped
things would be looking up – I’d just gotten back from an exciting
conference with good friends, and also from seeing the solar
eclipse.</p>
<p>I’d made the pilgrimage with friends. We drove for hours, east across
the mountains the week before they burned. We crossed the Colombia River
into Oregon, and finally, drove up a winding dirt road to a wide
clearing with a small pond. I studied for the GRE in the shadows of dry
pines. We played tug-of-war with the crayfish and watched the mayflies
dance above the pond. The morning of, the sun climbed in the sky, and I
had never appreciated how <em>invisible</em> the new moon is, or how
much light the sun puts out – even when it was half-gone, we still had
to peer through black plastic glasses to confirm that something had
changed. But soon, it became impossible not to notice.</p>
<p>I kept thinking about what state I would have been thrown into if I
hadn’t known the mechanism of an eclipse – how deep the pits of my
spiritual terror could go. Whether it would be limited by biology or
belief. As it is, it was only <em>sort</em> of spiritually terrifying,
in a good way. The part of my brain that <em>knew</em> what was
happening had spread that knowledge to all the other parts well, so I
could run around in excitement and really appreciate the chill in the
air, the eerie distortion of shadows into slivers, and finally, the moon
sealing off the sun.</p>
<p>The solar corona.</p>
<p>The sunset-colored horizon all around the rim of the sky.</p>
<p>Stars at midday.</p>
<p>We left after the daylight returned, but while the moon was still
easing away, eager to beat the crowds back to the city. I thought about
the mayflies in the pond, and their brief lives – the only adults in
hundreds of generations to see the sun, see the stars, and then see the
sun again.</p>
<p>I thought something might shake loose in my brain. Things should have
been looking up, but the adventures had scarcely touched the inertia.
Oh, right, I had also been thinking a lot about the end of the
world.</p>
<p>I wonder about the mental health of people who work in existential
risk. I think it must vary. I know people who are terrified on a very
emotional and immediate level, and I know people who clearly believe
it’s bad but don’t get anxious over it, and aren’t inclined to start. I
can’t blame them. I used to be more of the former, and now I’m not sure
if it’s eased up or if I’m just not thinking about things that
viscerally scare me anymore. I’m not sure the existential terror can tip
you towards something you weren’t predisposed to. In my case, I don’t
think the mental fog was <em>from</em> it. But the backdrop of
existential horror certainly lent it an interesting flavor.</p>
<p>It’s late October now. I’ve pulled out the flannel and the space
heater and the second blanket for the bed. When I went jogging, my hands
got numb. I don’t mind – I like autumn, I like the descent into winter,
heralded by rain and red leaves and darkness, and the trappings of
horror and then of the harvest. Peaches in the summertime, apples in the
fall. The seasons have a comforting rhyme to them.</p>
<p>That strange inertia hasn’t quite lifted, but I’m working on it.
Meanwhile, the world continues to cant sideways. When we arranged the
Stanislav Petrov day party in Seattle this year, to celebrate the day a
single man decided not to start World War 3, I wondered if we should
ease up on the “nuclear war is a terrifying prospect” theme we had laid
on last year. I thought that had probably been on people’s minds
already.</p>
<p>So geopolitical tensions are rising, and have been rising. The
hemisphere gets colder. Not quite out of nostalgia, my mind keeps
flickering back to last month, to not-quite-a-hundred-degrees Seattle,
to the red sun.</p>
<p>There’s a beautiful quote from Albert Camus: “In the midst of winter,
I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.” That Tuesday, like
the momentary pass of the moon over the sun in mid-day, in the height of
summer, I saw the shadow of a nuclear winter.</p>
