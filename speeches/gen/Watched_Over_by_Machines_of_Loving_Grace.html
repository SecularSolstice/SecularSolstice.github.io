<p>I like to think (and<br />
the sooner the better!)<br />
of a cybernetic meadow<br />
where mammals and computers<br />
live together in mutually<br />
programming harmony<br />
like pure water<br />
touching clear sky.</p>
<p>I like to think<br />
(right now, please!)<br />
of a cybernetic forest<br />
filled with pines and electronics<br />
where deer stroll peacefully<br />
past computers<br />
as if they were flowers<br />
with spinning blossoms.</p>
<p>I like to think<br />
(it has to be!)<br />
of a cybernetic ecology<br />
where we are free of our labors<br />
and joined back to nature,<br />
returned to our mammal<br />
brothers and sisters,<br />
and all watched over<br />
by machines of loving grace.</p>
