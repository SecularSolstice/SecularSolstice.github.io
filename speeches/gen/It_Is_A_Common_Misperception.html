<p>It is a common misconception that the best rationalists are Sorted
into Ravenclaw, leaving none for other Houses. This is not so; being
Sorted into Ravenclaw indicates that your strongest virtue is curiosity,
wondering and desiring to know the true answer. And this is not the only
virtue a rationalist needs. Sometimes you have to work hard on a
problem, and stick to it for a while.</p>
