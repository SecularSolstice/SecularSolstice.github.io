<h1 id="why-solstice-why-lovecraft">Why Solstice? Why Lovecraft?</h1>
<h2 id="by-james-babcock">By James Babcock</h2>
<p>Every year since 2013, the Boston community has held a Winter
Solstice celebration. We gather and sing songs, tell stories, and recite
litanies; celebrate the work that humanity has done for the past 5000
years; pay tribute to the harshness of the universe, respecting it as
worthy opponent.</p>
<p>The Winter Solstice is the longest night of the year. It is a time of
cold and darkness.</p>
<p>It marks the beginning of the return of the light. The days once
again grow longer. But it does not mark the end of the cold. For months
afterward, the world is frigid and life is fragile. For young
civilizations, if you hadn’t spent the year preparing adequately for the
future, then before spring returned, you would run out of food and die.
If you hadn’t striven to use your tribe’s collective wisdom, to work
hard beyond what was necessary for immediate gratification… if you
hadn’t harnessed the physical and mental tools that humans have but that
few other animals do… then the universe, unflinchingly neutral, would
destroy you without a thought. And even if you did do these things, it
might kill you anyway. Because fairness isn’t built into the equations
of the cosmos.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the threat of death that inspired the first winter
holidays. It was that sense of unfairness, coupled with the desperate
hope that world couldn’t really be that unfair. It wouldn’t have
occurred to the first squirrels that stored food for winter, but it
gradually dawned upon ancient hominids, as their capacity for abstract
reasoning developed, alongside their desire to throw parties.</p>
<p>Our tendency is to anthropomorphize. Today, we angrily yell at our
cars and computers when they fail us. Rationally we know they are
unthinking hulks of metal, but we still ascribe malevolence when the
real culprit is a broken, unsentient machine.</p>
<p>There are plausible reasons for humans to have evolved this trait.
One of the most complicated tasks a human has to do is predict the
actions of other humans. We need to be able to make allies, to identify
deceptive enemies, to please lovers. I’m not an evolutionary
psychologist and I should be careful when telling this sort of Just-So
story, but I can easily imagine selection pressures that resulted in a
powerful ability to draw conclusions about sentient creatures similar to
ourselves.</p>
<p>And then, there was not a whole lot of pressure to not use this tool
to predict, say, the weather. Many natural forces are just too complex
for humans to be good at predicting. The rain would come, or it
wouldn’t, regardless of whether we ascribed it to gods or “emergent
complexity.” So we told stories about gods, with human motivations, and
we honestly believed them because there was nothing better.</p>
<p>And then, we had the solstice.</p>
<p>The world was dark and cold. The sun had retreated, leaving us only
with the pale moon and stars that lay incredibly far away. There was the
enroaching threat of death, and just as powerfully, there was the threat
that sentient cosmic forces that held supreme power over our world were
turning their backs on us. And the best we could hope for was to throw a
celebration in their honor and pray that they wouldn’t be angry forever,
that the sun would return and the world would be reborn.</p>
<p>And regardless, take a moment to be glad for having worked hard the
previous year, so that we had meat stored up and wine that had finished
fermenting.</p>
<p>But as ages passed, people noticed something interesting: there was a
pattern to the gods getting angry.</p>
<p>Weather may be complex and nigh-unpredictable. But the movements of
the heavens… they follow rules simple enough for human minds to
understand, if only you take the time to look.</p>
<p>We had a question. “When will the sun retreat, and when will it
return?”</p>
<p>When you really care about knowing the answer, you can’t make
something up. When you need to plan your harvest and prepare for winter
so that your family doesn’t starve, you can’t just say “Oh, God will
stop getting angry in a few months.” If you want real knowledge, that
you can apply to make your world better, then you need to do
science.</p>
<p>Astronomy was born.</p>
<p>I want to give you some perspective on how much we cared about this.
Stonehenge is an ancient archaeological wonder. To the best of our
knowledge, it began as a burial site around 3000 BCE. Over the next
thousand years, it was gradually built, in major phases of activity
every few hundred years. Between 2600 and 2400 BCE, there was a surge of
construction. Huge stones were carted over huge distances, to create a
monument that’s lasted five thousand years.</p>
<p>30 Sarsen stones. Each of them was at least 25 tons. They were
carried 25 miles. 80 bluestones. Four tons each. Carried over 150
miles.</p>
<p>In this era, the height of locomotive technology was “throw it on a
pile of logs and roll it.”</p>
<p>We don’t know exactly how they did all this. We don’t know all the
reasons why. But we know at least one: The megaliths at Stonehenge are
arranged, very specifically, to predict the Solstices. To the moment of
dawn.</p>
<p>30 stones, each 25 tons, carried over 25 miles. 80 stones, each four
tons, each carried over 150 miles.</p>
<p>I want to repeat that last part one more time because it blows my
mind. Eighty stones, each eight thousand pounds, dragged over one
hundred and fifty miles, over the course of 200 years.</p>
<p>That’s how much we cared about the answer to that question.</p>
<p>So with that in mind: Who the hell is Lovecraft and why do we
care?</p>
<p>H.P. Lovecraft was a science fiction/horror writer from the 1920s. He
wrote about alien gods, about humans changing their bodies and minds,
about the pursuit of immortality. But what makes him particularly
relevant is one dominant underlying theme - that the universe is
absolutely, unforgivingly neutral. That human life and morality has no
inherent value. That mind-space is huge, and that possibility space is
even huger, and that 99% of the things in possibility space are utterly
terrifying to modern human values. “All my tales,” Lovecraft said, “are
based on the fundamental premise that common human laws and interests
and emotions have no validity or significance in the vast
cosmos-at-large.”</p>
<p>Lovecraft identified as an atheist, a materialist and even a
rationalist, and his protagonists often identify as such. He was also,
as far as I can tell, a pessimist who hated people in general. I’m not
sure what his beliefs about morality in the real world were, though most
of what I’ve heard isn’t good. But he fascinates me because his writings
suggest a dark mirror image of our ideals. Professor Quirrell to our
Harry Potter, as a certain fanfiction would have it.</p>
<p>This is how Call of Cthulhu begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of
the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island
of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not
meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own
direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing
together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of
reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go
mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety
of a new dark age.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We, of the Less Wrong community, have comprehended a glimpse of an
expanse of possibility-space outside the scope of most people’s
imagination. I know some people who are genuinely incapable of
processing it. I know others who would, unless they took an initially
painful plunge into the deep after us, look upon us with confusion and
despair.</p>
<p>In this Solstice Eve celebration, Cthulhu, Azathoth and the
Necronomicon play a part akin to Santa Claus - fun, ridiculous things
that don’t directly parallel AI or Existential Risk or Evolution or
Immortality, but which nonetheless pay tribute to the core ideas that
make those things important to us.</p>
