Evolutionary Humanism</h1>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Serve neither foreign nor familiar “gods”</em> (which, on
close inspection, are nothing more than naïve constructions of the
primate brain), but rather the great ideal of ethics to lessen the
suffering in the world. Those who claimed to be standing closest to
their “god” were often those who stood especially far from the
well-being and pain of real people. Do not get involved with that
tragedy. To possess science, philosophy and art means not to need
religion!</p></li>
<li><p><em>Behave fairly to your neighbour and also to those farthest
away!</em> You will not be able to love everyone but you should respect
that every person – even those you do not care for! – has the right to
implement their own ideas about “good living (and dying) in the here and
now” as long as these do not conflict with the equal rights of
others.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Have no fear of authorities, but rather the courage to reason
for yourself!</em> Keep in mind that the strength of an argument is
completely independent of who is making it. The truth of a statement
depends only on whether it is logically consistent and corresponds to
our real experience of the world. If today someone argues with “god on
his side” this should generate not awe but roars of laughter.</p></li>
<li><p><em>You shall not lie, cheat, steal or kill – unless, in an
emergency, there is no other way of asserting the ideals of
humanity!</em> Those who, under the Nazi dictatorship, did not lie, but
rather willingly divulged the hiding places of Jewish families to the
Gestapo, behaved in a highly unethical manner – in contrast to those who
wanted to assassinate Hitler in order to save millions of people’s
lives. Ethical behaviour means not blindly following a set of moral
commandments or prohibitions; instead, it requires us, in the particular
situation, to weigh up the positive and negative consequences of a
decision.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Free yourself from the bad habit of moralizing!</em> There is
no such thing in the world as “good” and “evil” but merely people with
differing interests, needs and learning experiences. Contribute to
ameliorating the catastrophic conditions under which people today are
wasting away, and you will be amazed at the friendly, creative and
lovable side that the apparent “beast” Homo sapiens can show.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Do not immunize yourself against criticism!</em> Honest
criticism is a gift that you should not reject. Through such criticism
you stand to lose only your errors, which you should cast aside today
rather than tomorrow. Have pity on those who are unable to accept
criticism, and who out of deep fear have to present themselves as
“infallible” and their dogmas as “holy” (untouchable). They should no
longer be taken seriously in a modern society.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Do not be too confident!</em> That which appears certain to
us today can be out of date tomorrow! But even doubt should be doubted!
Although our knowledge is permanently limited and tentative, you should
stand by those things of which you are convinced. But in doing so, be
open for better arguments, because only in that way will you succeed in
mastering the narrow path beyond dogmatism and “anything goes”.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Overcome any tendency towards tradition blindness by
informing yourself in depth from all sides before making a
decision!</em> As a human, you have at your disposal an extraordinarily
adaptive brain – do not let it go to waste! Be careful to apply the same
rational principles in questions of ethics and ideology that you need to
operate a smartphone or a computer. A species that can split the atom
and communicate via satellite has to be mature enough to do
this.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Enjoy your life because it is highly probable that it will be
the only one you have!</em> Be aware of your own, and of all our
finiteness, do not repress it but rather “seize the day” (Carpe diem)!
It is precisely the finiteness of an individual life that makes it so
unbelievably precious! Let no one persuade you that it is a disgrace to
be happy! On the contrary: By enjoying the freedom you possess today you
are honouring those who lost their lives fighting for it in the
past!</p></li>
<li><p><em>Put your life in the service of a “greater cause”, become a
part of the tradition of those who desire(d) to make the world a better
place in which to live.</em> Such an attitude is not only ethically
tenable, but also the best recipe for a fulfilled existence. It seems
that altruists are the cleverer egoists, because the greatest fulfilment
of our self-interest lies in achieving its extension to others. If you
feel that you are part of the “heat-flow of human history”, that will
make you happier than any imaginable possession. You will intuitively
sense that you are not alive for nothing and that your life is not, and
will not have been, in vain!</p></li>
