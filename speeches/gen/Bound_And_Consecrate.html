<p>Now that we’re warmed up, let me welcome you properly to the 2018 New
York Solstice.</p>
<p>We gather now, at the darkest time of year, to face darkness. Because
winter used to be scary, and it is still a good time to face fear.</p>
<p>We gather here, in this theatre, because it available, affordable,
and almost big enough. So it goes.</p>
<p>Where we are affects who we are. We should not come to this night as
our theater-going selves, but as something deeper. So let’s do something
about that.</p>
<p>Let us bound this space. That is, let us set boundaries for it, to
divide it from the outside world. From wall to wall, including the AV
booth in the back, is ours. The outside world is… outside.</p>
<p>And let us consecrate this space. This is not just our space for
conducting ordinary business, but for this special occasion.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I ask you to rise and turn to the East (that way)
with me…</p>
<p>By the virtues of East, By the rising sun and the innocent curiosity
of youth, Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we filter incoming ideas lest we be overwhelmed.
On this night, let us resolve to consider all we hear.</p>
<p>(And together we say)</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of East, we bound and consecrate this
space.</em></p>
<p>(Please turn to the south)</p>
<p>By the virtues of South, By heat, passion and will. Let us bound and
consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we live among outsiders, and worry what they
will think of us. On this night, we are in our own space. We have
claimed it by our will. Outsiders and their opinions can stay out.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of South, we bound and consecrate this
space.</em></p>
<p>By the virtues of West, By the setting sun and the wisdom of age, Let
us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we worry over our immediate tasks and
obligations. On this night, let us strive to perceive the vast expanse
of history.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of West, we bound and consecrate this
space.</em></p>
<p>By the virtues of North, By the solidarity and friendship we share
with one another Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we are scattered. Tonight, we sit together. We
support each other. We are one people.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of North, we bound and consecrate this
space.</em></p>
<p>(Please face me and look down)</p>
<p>By the virtues of Down, By pain, guilt and fear – the great gifts no
one wants, Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we flinch from the worst possibilities, either
for our own sake or to avoid looking weak to a predator. Tonight, as one
people, we face the darkness squarely.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of Down, we bound and consecrate this
space.</em></p>
<p>By the virtues of Up, By the stars and the hope and ambition to reach
them, Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we hide our greatest ambitions, lest we be
thought of as cheating at status games. Tonight we speak them openly,
and remember that however distant they may be, they are good
ambitions.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of Up, we bound and consecrate this
space.</em></p>
