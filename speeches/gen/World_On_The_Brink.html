<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 1 </strong></p>
<p>The year is 1940. My name is Noel Regney, and the Germans have just
invaded my country. Close friends of mine are dead. I have been drafted
into the Nazi army against my will. Forced to wear their uniform. Forced
to do things I am not proud of.</p>
<p>But I find ways to keep fighting for my country. From within Nazi
ranks. I work as a spy for the French Resistance. And eventually, I
arrange an ambush. My company falls into my trap. In the crossfire I am
shot. But I survive, and I flee here, to Manhattan.</p>
<p>And in this new country, I begin to build a home. I join a Unitarian
Universalist church. I marry a woman named Gloria with a voice like an
angel, and we begin to write music together. Our songs play on radios
across the country.</p>
<p>In 1942, my new country drops a bomb on Hiroshima.</p>
<p>And just like that, fifty thousand people are dead.</p>
<p>That’s the sort of thing that can happen, suddenly. Just like
that.</p>
<p>In the wake of that explosion, a new kind of cold settles over the
world. Radios and televisions across the country begin to tell stories
about a possible apocalypse. My children are taught that if a nuclear
strike is launched, they should push their desk against the wall and
squat beneath.</p>
<p>We know that squatting beneath a wooden desk isn’t actually going to
help, but we pretend like it does.</p>
<p>It’s something to do. It’s better than nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker 2</strong></p>
<p>The year is 1962, and my name is Vasili Arkhipov. I am an officer in
the Soviet Navy.</p>
<p>The United States has put nuclear missiles in Turkey, in range of my
country. To counter, my Russian leaders put nuclear missiles in Cuba,
within striking distance of the US. The Americans bare their teeth. We
raise their hackles. The hairs on our necks stand on end.</p>
<p>Our leaders and theirs want to de-escalate, but our militaries have
thousands of moving parts. The labyrinth of game theory and politics
we’ve woven around ourselves seems impossible to escape.</p>
<p>My submarine is off the coast of Cuba, and we’ve just lost contact
with Moscow. My Captain and his third in command believe that nuclear
war has already begun. They want to launch our nuclear torpedo in
retaliation. My Captain is ready. His hand hovers over the button.</p>
<p>As Second in command, my authorization is needed to strike. I believe
that too much is at stake. I argue, fiercely, that we must wait, that we
must surface and seek further orders. Tempers rise. Everyone yells. But
in the end, the captain listens. We wait.</p>
<p>In the morning, the sun rises. Hiding in our silent ship, we still
don’t know what’s happening on the surface. We’re dripping sweat. But
the world turns, and humanity lives on. For now.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1</strong></p>
<p>In Manhattan, I go to work each morning – my coworkers and I listen
to the radio all day, waiting for an announcement that everything is
about to end. I walk home each night, silent.</p>
<p>I go to sleep beside my wife and children, uncertain whether I’ll
wake up the next day. But each morning the sunlight keeps spilling
through the window curtain.</p>
<p>I walk home for the third time that week. It’s cold October night.
There’s a star shining bright above me and I want to find it beautiful
but all I can think about missiles flashing in the sky, and I feel so
powerless and alone.</p>
<p>And then I round a corner.</p>
<p>And I see two women. Each is pushing a stroller, and in each stroller
is a baby. The two children look at each other. And they smile. And they
laugh. And they have no idea what’s happening.</p>
<p>And in that moment, a song comes to me, lyrics forming in my head as
fast as I can think them. I arrive home and share it with my wife. And
she sits at the piano and writes a melody and then we start singing. And
we can’t sing it all the way through without breaking down sobbing, but
we hold each other and try again.</p>
<p>The song is written in the language of the Christian stories. But the
plea is universal. A desperate hope that thousands of confident
ideologies, economic doctrines and religions could find a way to
coexist, in a world where they had the power to destroy each other.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[One of the candles is extinguished. Speaker 1’s mannerisms change to
his usual self]</p>
<p>The year is 2013. My name is Raymond Arnold, and I’m listening to the
song Do You Hear What I Hear. I’m reading about a week in human history
– where one man on a submarine stopped a nuclear war. Where another man
in manhattan wrote a desperate plea for peace, that people promptly
misinterpreted and ignored.</p>
<p>And I’m noticing, that the song was about the birth of a story.</p>
<p>The story is born, like all of us, small, and powerless. Whispered by
the night wind to the humblest of creatures. But each person it touches,
it helps to become stronger, and wiser. And they in turn help the story
to evolve – to become more useful, and more powerful.</p>
<p>The story gives a shepherd boy the courage to walk before a king and
demand his attention. It gives the king the humility to listen, and to
learn.</p>
<p>And then, having reached the ear of the king, the story changes the
world.</p>
<p>And it occurs to me, that the lyrics to this song are, in fact,
incredibly open ended. From its birth, this song has been steeped in
metaphor, and evolving interpretation.</p>
<p>So I would like us to sing this song together, in honor of those two
children, on that cold october night, who woke up the next day. Who
lived to grow old. Who, one way or another, brought a little more light
to the world.</p>
<p>[Do You Hear What I Hear is sung, transitioning into a faint reprise
of Bring the Light.]</p>
<p><strong>Speaker 2</strong></p>
<p>The year is 1989. My name is Elizabeth Liddell, and I am about to
turn 8 years old. I’m coming down the stairs to the living room, where
Dad’s watching the evening news, as usual. “Wait a minute,” he says.
“Come watch this.” He points to the TV, where I see a group of teenagers
with mohawks and studded leather jackets taking sledgehammers to a
vertical slab of spray-painted concrete. I watch for a few minutes, and
then I wander off. I didn’t really know what was so important about
those teenagers that Dad felt I should stop and watch, but I remembered
it.</p>
<p>To this day, I remember watching that clip of the news, watching what
I now understand were German teenagers helping to tear down the Berlin
Wall at the end of the Cold War. My father, who had lived through the
Great Depression, Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, World War II, Korea,
Vietnam, and the Cold War, recognized the monumental importance of that
event, and made sure his daughter stopped and took note – even if I was
too young to understand at the time.</p>
<p>History is a funny thing.</p>
<p>The same terrifying game theory that led us to the brink of nuclear
war, also led us to a new frontier.</p>
<p>The US and the Soviets didn’t go to space for the noblest of reasons.
It’d be nice to claim we did it for science, or for the adventure. But
mostly, the space program is just one more weapon in our ideological
war.</p>
<p>But it’s interesting. Once humanity finally got to space, we turned
around, and we saw that.</p>
<p>[Gestures to the a video of the earth from space, camera slowly
pulling away to reveal the Pale Blue Dot photo]</p>
<p>And for the first time, anyone making a plea for peace, anyone
desperately begging for people to put aside their grievances and protect
their home, has a symbol they can point to, and say:</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
