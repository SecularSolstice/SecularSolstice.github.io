Home</h1>
<p>Dear Mother, I am writing from the trenches. It is 11 o’clock in the
morning. Beside me is a coke fire, opposite me a ‘dug-out’ (wet) with
straw in it. The ground is sloppy in the actual trench, but frozen
elsewhere. In my mouth is a pipe presented by the Princess Mary. In the
pipe is tobacco. Of course, you say. But wait. In the pipe is German
tobacco. Haha, you say, from a prisoner or found in a captured trench.
Oh dear, no! From a German soldier. Yes a live German soldier from his
own trench. Yesterday the British &amp; Germans met &amp; shook hands in
the Ground between the trenches, &amp; exchanged souvenirs, &amp; shook
hands. Yes, all day Xmas day, &amp; as I write. Marvellous, isn’t
it?</p>
