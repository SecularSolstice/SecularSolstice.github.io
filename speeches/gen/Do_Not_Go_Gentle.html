<h1 id="do-not-go-gentle-into-that-good-night">Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</h1>
<h2 id="by-dylan-thomas">By Dylan Thomas</h2>
<p>Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
<p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
<p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
