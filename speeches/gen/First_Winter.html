<h1 id="the-first-winter">The First Winter</h1>
<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>You’re tribe is traveling north.</p>
<p>And the sun’s falling low in the sky.<br />
Getting dimmer than you’ve ever seen,<br />
And it’s starting to feel like it’s saying goodbye.<br />
And you don’t know why, no idea what it means.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s something you did?<br />
Or maybe it’s something we said?<br />
But your children are shivering cold,<br />
and the world around you is dead.</p>
<p>You shout to the sky, but it won’t hear you.<br />
You scream to the wind… it don’t care.<br />
But there’s more than just one of you down here.<br />
So if anyone’s out there…</p>
<p>Well we’re making you listen.<br />
Make you hear us somehow.<br />
And we’ll try an’ understand all your wisdom and plans,<br />
But we got a problem right now.</p>
<p>And we’re not going quietly into the night.<br />
We won’t turn around, lie down or give up the fight<br />
And our old and our young raise their voices as one.<br />
We’re gonna bring back the sun:</p>
<p>Bring the light….</p>
