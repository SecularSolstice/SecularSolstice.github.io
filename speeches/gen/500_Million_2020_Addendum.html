<p>[Note: this speech is no longer endorsed by its author due to obvious failure of prediction.]</p>
<p>There’s one more thing to add this year.</p>
<p>Globally, as of this week, about 1.6 million people have died of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Within months after COVID claimed its first victim, we sequenced its genome. Within weeks of that, we developed vaccines using brand-new, extraordinarily powerful biological technology. Within one year, we began a worldwide campaign to deploy it to every corner of the Earth, erasing this disease once and for all.</p>
<p>If three times as many people die of the novel coronavirus next year, it will still be just over 1% of the death toll that smallpox took on humanity before it was extinguished forever.</p>
<p>You are a member of the species that did that. Never forget what we are capable of, when we band together and declare battle on what is broken in the world.</p>
<p>Never forget that you are part of the species that will destroy SaRS-Cov2.</p>
