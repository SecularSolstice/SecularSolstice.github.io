<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>[Note: Ray has complicated feelings about this speech, because some
of the facts about Stonehenge may not be accurate.]</p>
<p>The Winter Solstice is the longest night of the year. It ushers in a
time of cold and darkness.</p>
<p>It marks the beginning of the light’s return. But it is not the end
of the cold. For months afterwards, food is scarce and life is
fragile.</p>
<p>For young civilizations, it was a time when if you hadn’t spent the
year preparing adequately for the future, then before spring returned,
you would run out of food and die. If you hadn’t striven to use your
tribe’s collective wisdom, to work hard beyond what was necessary for
immediate gratification… if you hadn’t harnessed the physical and mental
tools that humans have but that few other animals do…</p>
<p>…then the universe, unflinchingly neutral, would destroy you without
a thought. And even if you did do those things, you might die anyway.
Fairness isn’t built into the equations of the cosmos.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the threat of death that inspired the first winter
holidays. It was that sense of unfairness, coupled with the desperate
hope that the world couldn’t really be that unfair. It wouldn’t have
occurred to the first squirrels that stored food for winter, but it
gradually dawned upon ancient hominids, as their capacity for abstract
reasoning developed, alongside their desire to throw parties.</p>
<p>Our tendency is to anthropomorphize. Since ancient times, we’ve seen
faces in the clouds. Today, we angrily yell at our cars and computers
when they fail us. Rationally we know they are unthinking hulks of
metal, but we still ascribe malevolence when the real culprit is a
broken, unsentient machine. For whatever reason, animals of all kinds
have a tendency to see patterns in the noise, even when no patterns
exist. There is a natural yearning to find meaning in complexity.</p>
<p>One way or another, we told stories about gods with human
motivations. And we honestly believed them, because there was nothing
better. Many natural forces were just too complex for early humans to be
good at predicting. The rain would come, or it wouldn’t, no matter what
stories we told.</p>
<p>And then, we had the solstice.</p>
<p>The world was dark and cold. The sun was retreating, leaving us only
with the pale moon and stars that lay unimaginably far away. There was
the encroaching threat of death, and just as powerfully, there was the
threat that sentient cosmic forces that held supreme power over our
world were turning their backs on us. And the best we could hope for was
to throw a celebration in their honor and pray that they wouldn’t be
angry forever, that the sun would return and the world would be
reborn.</p>
<p>And regardless, take a moment to be glad for having worked hard the
previous year, so that we had meat stored up and wine that had finished
fermenting.</p>
<p>But as ages passed, people noticed something interesting: there was a
pattern to the gods getting angry. Weather may be complex and
nigh-unpredictable. But the movements of the heavens… they follow rules
simple enough for human minds to understand, if only you take the time
to look.</p>
<p>We had a question. “When will the sun retreat, and when will it
return?”</p>
<p>When you really care about knowing the answer, you can’t make
something up. When you need to plan your harvest and prepare for winter
so that your family doesn’t starve, you can’t just say “Oh, God will
stop getting angry in a few months.”</p>
<p>If you want real knowledge, that you can apply to make your world
better, then you need to do science. Astronomy was born.</p>
<p>I want to give you some perspective on how much we cared about this.
Stonehenge is an ancient archaeological wonder. To the best of our
knowledge, it began as a burial site around 3000 BCE. Over the next
thousand years, it was gradually built, in major phases of activity
every few hundred years. Between 2600 and 2400 BCE, there was a surge of
construction. Huge stones were carted over huge distances, to create a
monument that’s lasted five thousand years.</p>
<p>Thirty Sarsen stones, each twenty-five tons, carried over twenty five
miles. Eighty bluestones. Four tons each. Each of them carried over one
hundred and fifty miles. All of this, in an era where the height of
locomotive technology was “throw it on a pile of logs and roll it.”</p>
<p>We don’t know exactly how they did all this. We don’t know all the
reasons why. But we know at least one. The megaliths at Stonehenge are
arranged, very specifically, to predict the Solstice to the moment of
dawn.</p>
<p>Thirty Sarsen stones, each twenty-five tons, carried over twenty five
miles. Eighty bluestones, each four tons, each carried over one hundred
and fifty miles.</p>
<p>Two hundred years years of that.</p>
<p>That’s how much we cared about the answer to that question.</p>
