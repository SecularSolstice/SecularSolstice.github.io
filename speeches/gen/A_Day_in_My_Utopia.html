<p>When I wake up, the sun has risen and only one of my housemates is
still at home.</p>
<p>Our house is designed for group living. We each have our own
apartments with a bathroom and a private study/workroom, but the kitchen
and living room are shared. Architects designed the house to maximize
the possibility that housemates would run into each other in the common
areas, to promote incidental socialization. I don’t know exactly how
they did it, because I haven’t studied architecture yet.</p>
<p>Group houses are just one of the things our society has developed to
combat loneliness. Free time helps a lot; people don’t come home from
working two jobs too tired to do anything but watch TV. On the ground
floor of every apartment building are places for socializing:
coffeeshops and bowling alleys, nightclubs and board-game clubs, toddler
play spaces and libraries. Dating-site algorithms have been honed to a
science, and exist for platonic friends too. There are special programs
for people who have difficulty finding friends to meet each other. And,
frankly, one of the few things that’s scarce is people who need to be
helped: few people want to be befriended altruistically, but it is
better than having no friends at all, and it often builds
self-confidence and social skills that lead to people becoming genuinely
well-liked.</p>
<p>The one housemate who’s still here eats a muffin. We make small talk
about how work is going. He likes having more money than most people do–
I think it mostly goes to hiring a maid once a week and to his habit of
leaving hundred-dollar bills on street corners to watch people be
ecstatic about finding them. So he works one of the absolutely necessary
jobs that most people won’t do for free. He monitors an automated shoe
factory. It turns out tens of thousands of shoes a day and has three
employees.</p>
<p>I do some writing. I’m working on an extremely obscure fanfiction
with an audience of four people. But honestly becoming more famous would
just be tiring. I’m happy pleasing four of my friends and maybe another
person who stumbles across it and finds it wonderful.</p>
<p>I’ve put it off long enough: it’s time to start preparing for the
festival. Sometimes it seems like every other weekend is a festival or
holiday of some sort, although of course you don’t help at every one.
Some people do nothing but plan and execute holiday festivals. It seems
incredibly tiring and stressful to me, but they just seem to thrive on
it.</p>
<p>The upcoming festival is for Geek Pride Day, and I’m signed up to
improv a character (they’re from a modern movie, you wouldn’t have heard
of it). I run through my spaced repetition deck of obscure facts about
my character’s backstory; there’s always one person who takes pride in
tripping you up. I note down a few more lines I might want to try using;
it’s always a good idea to have some patter scripted out for those
routine conversations. My female housemate is making my costume, which
is good, because I don’t have a head for crafts.</p>
<p>That evening, I check on my child in the artificial womb. He still
kind of looks like a freaky alien, but his vital signs are fine. I pet
the glass of his womb; although I know it’s just a reflex reaction, I
imagine that he’s waving at me.</p>
<p>Once my son is born, I’m going to set aside a lot of things I
currently do to focus on him. That isn’t required, of course; children
grow up fine if their parents have lots of hobbies, or even a full-time
job of thirty hours a week. But I think it’s really cool to watch a
person grow and show him all the good things about the world, and I’d
like to be able to focus on that. And it’s not like my projects can’t be
put on the backburner. I work a lot because I like to, but most of my
work doesn’t pay; I live on my basic income.</p>
<p>Outside the hospital, I meet my girlfriend. She’s a scientist. She’s
free to work on whatever interests her, without having to scramble for
grant money or p-hack results out of her experiments; all her papers are
freely available to anyone who wants to read them.We gossip about how
the crowdfunding of CERN’s latest particle accelerator is going.
Particle accelerators are expensive enough that they can’t fund it from
their basic incomes, the way my girlfriend buys her chemicals. But it
looks like there are enough science fanboys with spare cash that it’ll
get funded.</p>
<p>We walk two blocks and go past five or six excellent little
restaurants before eventually deciding we want to go to the salad place.
We live in a dense city, so there’s a restaurant to cater to any taste
within walking distance. The salad place is owned by a guy who really
really likes making salads. There are also automated restaurants with
fast but predictably crappy food, produced by machine. Of course you
order with an app and pick up the food yourself. Waiters get paid more
than my housemate the factory manager does, and thus are only employed
at the sort of restaurant where the bill comes to a thousand dollars or
so.</p>
<p>Normally my girlfriend and I would take a late-night walk, but at
midnight tonight there’s a show out on the water. It’s pretty crowded,
and if you want a good seat you have to cough up a few hundred bucks;
people have enough disposable income that inherently scarce things get
really really expensive. But there’s always a lot of standing room, and
it still looks beautiful from far away.</p>
<p>An orchestra plays. Lights glitter. Fountains shoot water into the
air. A mist descends, and rainbow lights dance across it; they resolve
into clips of nature, famous movies, the stars. Fireworks explode in the
background. The creators are free from worries about hunger, thirst,
homelessness, disease; they are free to do whatever they want, and they
choose to make beautiful things, to pursue excellence and art for art’s
sake, to make things that others marvel at and to marvel at others’
creations in return.</p>
