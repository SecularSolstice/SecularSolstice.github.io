Threat</h1>
<h2 id="by-matt-elder">By Matt Elder</h2>
<p>These days, of course, the winter is no longer a real threat. In the
past millennia, we’ve learned how to cope with the cold and wet and
snow. We construct large, heated buildings. We light our homes to extend
the light of day. We haul crops from all over the world so that we can
eat all year round. We have cities, and industry, and science. We have
transformed human life.</p>
<p>And because of all humanity has created, we now have very different
powers, and problems, and responsibilities.</p>
