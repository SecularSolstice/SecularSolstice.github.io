<h3 id="a-poem-about-recovering.">A poem about recovering.</h3>
<p>After every war<br />
someone has to clean up.<br />
Things won’t<br />
straighten themselves up, after all.</p>
<p>Someone has to push the rubble<br />
to the side of the road,<br />
so the corpse-filled wagons<br />
can pass.</p>
<p>Someone has to get mired<br />
in scum and ashes,<br />
sofa springs,<br />
splintered glass,<br />
and bloody rags.</p>
<p>Someone has to drag in a girder<br />
to prop up a wall.<br />
Someone has to glaze a window,<br />
rehang a door.</p>
<p>Photogenic it’s not,<br />
and takes years.<br />
All the cameras have left<br />
for another war.</p>
<p>We’ll need the bridges back,<br />
and new railway stations.<br />
Sleeves will go ragged<br />
from rolling them up.</p>
<p>Someone, broom in hand,<br />
still recalls the way it was.<br />
Someone else listens<br />
and nods with unsevered head.<br />
But already there are those nearby<br />
starting to mill about<br />
who will find it dull.</p>
<p>From out of the bushes<br />
sometimes someone still unearths<br />
rusted-out arguments<br />
and carries them to the garbage pile.</p>
<p>Those who knew<br />
what was going on here<br />
must make way for<br />
those who know little.<br />
And less than little.<br />
And finally as little as nothing.</p>
<p>In the grass that has overgrown<br />
causes and effects,<br />
someone must be stretched out<br />
blade of grass in his mouth<br />
gazing at the clouds.</p>
