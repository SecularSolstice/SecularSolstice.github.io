<h1 id="hot-seat">Hot Seat</h1>
<p>Dividing the group in groups of ~4 people each. Going around,
everyone is in the “Hot seat” for 5 minutes each. That means that others
are asking you questions they are interested in hearing the answer to -
whatever they want to ask. The person in focus is allowed to answer the
question, refuse an answer or lie. (Plus some more rules etc.)</p>
<p>This game can be an initial get-to know but ideally helps people ask
deep questions that they wouldn’t dare to ask in the usual social
context (such as e.g. “What are you most afraid of?”) and for the
receiving end to answer them while being sure to get heard and listened
to. After going around the circle and giving everyone the chance to be
in the hot seat, the group discusses their experience and then returns
in the larger circle to share their insights and feelings from the
session.</p>
