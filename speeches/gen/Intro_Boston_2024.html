<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Welcome to Winter Solstice. We are gathered here tonight on the
longest night of the year, and most importantly NOT DEAD YET.</p>
<p>Some of you might have been coming here for years. Some of you might
be here for the very first time. All of you are welcome. Those of you
who have been to these before, please shout out what number Solstice
this is for you. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And those of you who haven’t, please shout “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m so glad you asked. I’m going to be unusually overt about what
we’re doing.</p>
<p>Holidays and traditions are, among other things, a way to feel a
sense of camaraderie with one another. It helps make friends, and if
you’re persistent about doing them regularly, it helps feel like you’re
a part of a larger community. </p>
<p>The first step of Solstice was about fourteen billion years ago,
which is the current estimate for the origin of the universe. Really,
that’s the first step of anything if you think about it. The second step
of Solstice was about four and a half billion years ago, which is about
when the earth formed in its orbit and would begin to have a point when
parts of its surface were tilted away from the sun more often, creating
shorter days and longer nights. The third step of Solstice was around
twelve thousand years ago, which is our current best guess for when
religion became a feature of human society. We started telling stories
about why it was that things got dark, and cold, and hard. We started
traditions.</p>
<p>Our stories were wrong. But in the telling of those stories, we
bonded with each other. That bond was good and valuable thing, and those
stories weren’t utterly and completely wrong; it really did get colder
for a while, then warmer. As well as being persistence hunters, humans
turn out to be really persistent about forming bonds with each other too
so tonight we’re here to carry on a pattern that’s older than writing.
We are gathered here as a community to mark the longest night of the
year with a ritual that upholds our values.</p>
<p>It’s also fun. I’m here because I enjoy it. I hope you do too.</p>
<p>I only want to gently nudge you towards thinking of yourself as one
of us. Such things shouldn’t be rushed. Eventually you will know whether
you are or not.</p>
<p>But I do want you to feel welcome. Even if you’re confused. We’re all
confused, one way or another.</p>
<p>And I do want you to be a part of things tonight. Tonight isn’t about
those of us on stage doing things to you or for you. It’s about everyone
in this room doing things together. We’re going to have music tonight,
but the music is for all of us to sing along with together. We’ll have
speeches, but the speakers are members of the community who volunteered
when I asked.</p>
<p>I keep saying the word “community” like it’s something weighty. Some
of us have known each other for a decade, some of us just show up for
the board game nights. There are serious, long-term efforts to make the
world a lastingly better place, and also I found these people because of
some funny Harry Potter fanfiction on the internet. We contain
multitudes.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Harry Potter thing- some of you are going to pick up
on a particular theme that many of the speeches and songs will touch on
tonight. It’s an appreciation for hard work and loyal friendship. I’m
not going to badger you too much with jokes about it- well, apart from
that one pun- but I wanted you to have that frame in mind.</p>
<p><em>“Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin, wannabe heroes
in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work in
Hufflepuff.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Chapter 9</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s enough introduction for now. On with the ritual. Stepping up
the seriousness one small notch.</p>
