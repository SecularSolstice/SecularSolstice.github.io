<p>But even after we have thrown away science, art, love, and
philosophy, there’s still one thing left to lose. One final sacrifice
runaway competitive pressure might demand of us: being anyone at
all.</p>
<p>To quote Nick Bostrom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We could imagine, as an extreme case, a technologically highly
advanced society, containing many complex structures, some of them far
more intricate and intelligent than anything that exists on the planet
today – a society which nevertheless lacks any type of being that is
conscious or whose welfare has moral significance. In a sense, this
would be an uninhabited society. It would be a society of economic
miracles and technological awesomeness, with nobody there to benefit. A
Disneyland with no children.</p>
