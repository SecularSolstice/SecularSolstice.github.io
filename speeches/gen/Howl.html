<h1 id="howl">Howl</h1>
<h2 id="by-allen-ginsberg">By Allen Ginsberg</h2>
<p>I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving
hysterical naked,</p>
<p>dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an
angry fix,</p>
<p>angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to
the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,</p>
<p>who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in
the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops
of cities contemplating jazz,</p>
<p>who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan
angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,</p>
<p>who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating
Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,</p>
<p>who were expelled from the academies for crazy &amp; publishing
obscene odes on the windows of the skull,</p>
<p>who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in
wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,</p>
<p>who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a
belt of marijuana for New York,</p>
<p>who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley,
death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night</p>
<p>with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and
endless balls,</p>
<p>incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the
mind leaping toward poles of Canada &amp; Paterson, illuminating all the
motionless world of Time between,</p>
<p>Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine
drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride
neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the
roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of
mind,</p>
<p>who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery
to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children
brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain
all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,</p>
<p>who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford’s floated out and
sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi’s, listening to
the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,</p>
<p>who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to
Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,</p>
<p>a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the
stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the
moon,</p>
<p>yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and
anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and
wars,</p>
<p>whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights
with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,</p>
<p>who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous
picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,</p>
<p>suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines
of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark’s bleak furnished room,</p>
<p>who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard
wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,</p>
<p>who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow
toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,</p>
<p>who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop
kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in
Kansas,</p>
<p>who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian
angels who were visionary indian angels,</p>
<p>who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural
ecstasy,</p>
<p>who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse
of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,</p>
<p>who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex
or soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America
and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,</p>
<p>who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving behind nothing
but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in
fireplace Chicago,</p>
<p>who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and
shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out
incomprehensible leaflets,</p>
<p>who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic
tobacco haze of Capitalism,</p>
<p>who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and
undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed
down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,</p>
<p>who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before
the machinery of other skeletons,</p>
<p>who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in
policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty
and intoxication,</p>
<p>who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof
waving genitals and manuscripts,</p>
<p>who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and
screamed with joy,</p>
<p>who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors,
caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,</p>
<p>who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the
grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to
whomever come who may,</p>
<p>who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob
behind a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond &amp; naked angel
came to pierce them with a sword,</p>
<p>who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed
shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of
the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and
snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman’s loom,</p>
<p>who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a
sweetheart a package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and
continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the
wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of
consciousness,</p>
<p>who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the
sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the
snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the
lake,</p>
<p>who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars,
N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver—joy to
the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots &amp; diner
backyards, moviehouses’ rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with
gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings &amp;
especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, &amp; hometown alleys
too,</p>
<p>who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on
a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hung-over
with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams &amp;
stumbled to unemployment offices,</p>
<p>who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank
docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full of
steam-heat and opium,</p>
<p>who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment cliff-banks of the
Hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon &amp; their heads
shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,</p>
<p>who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the
muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery,</p>
<p>who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of
onions and bad music,</p>
<p>who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose
up to build harpsichords in their lofts,</p>
<p>who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the
tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,</p>
<p>who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations
which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,</p>
<p>who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht &amp; tortillas
dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,</p>
<p>who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,</p>
<p>who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for
Eternity outside of Time, &amp; alarm clocks fell on their heads every
day for the next decade,</p>
<p>who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up
and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were
growing old and cried,</p>
<p>who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison
Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse &amp; the tanked-up clatter of the
iron regiments of fashion &amp; the nitroglycerine shrieks of the
fairies of advertising &amp; the mustard gas of sinister intelligent
editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute
Reality,</p>
<p>who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked
away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup
alleyways &amp; firetrucks, not even one free beer,</p>
<p>who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway
window, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over
the street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph
records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and
threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the
blast of colossal steamwhistles,</p>
<p>who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each other’s
hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation,</p>
<p>who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision
or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,</p>
<p>who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver
&amp; waited in vain, who watched over Denver &amp; brooded &amp; loned
in Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, &amp; now Denver
is lonesome for her heroes,</p>
<p>who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each
other’s salvation and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its
hair for a second,</p>
<p>who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible
criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who
sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,</p>
<p>who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender
Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive
or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,</p>
<p>who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism &amp; were
left with their insanity &amp; their hands &amp; a hung jury,</p>
<p>who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently
presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with shaven
heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous
lobotomy,</p>
<p>and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol
electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong
&amp; amnesia,</p>
<p>who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table,
resting briefly in catatonia,</p>
<p>returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears
and fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of
the East,</p>
<p>Pilgrim State’s Rockland’s and Greystone’s foetid halls, bickering
with the echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight
solitude-bench dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies
turned to stone as heavy as the moon,</p>
<p>with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book flung out of
the tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 A.M. and the last
telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room
emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose
twisted on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing
but a hopeful little bit of hallucination—</p>
<p>ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you’re really
in the total animal soup of time—</p>
<p>and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden
flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis catalogue a variable
measure and the vibrating plane,</p>
<p>who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time &amp; Space through images
juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soul between 2 visual
images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of
consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens
Aeterna Deus</p>
<p>to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand
before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected
yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his
naked and endless head,</p>
<p>the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here
what might be left to say in time come after death,</p>
<p>and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn
shadow of the band and blew the suffering of America’s naked mind for
love into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered
the cities down to the last radio</p>
<p>with the absolute heart of the poem of life butchered out of their
own bodies good to eat a thousand years.</p>
<hr />
<p>What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate
up their brains and imagination?</p>
<p>Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars!

electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius!
Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is
the Mind!</p>

Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!</p>
<p>Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness
without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy!
Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the
sky!</p>
<p>Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton
treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations!
invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!</p>
<p>They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees,
radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere
about us!</p>
<p>Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the
American river!</p>
<p>Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of
sensitive bullshit!</p>
<p>Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the
flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and
suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of
Time!</p>
<p>Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the
holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude!
waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!</p>
