<h2 id="by-eliezer-yudkowsky-and-raymond-arnold">By Eliezer Yudkowsky
and Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>I remember, from distant childhood, what it’s like to live in the
world where God exists. <em>Really</em> exists, the way that children
and rationalists take all their beliefs at face value.</p>
<p>In the world where God exists, he doesn’t intervene to optimize
<em>everything</em>. God won’t make you a sandwich. Parents don’t do
everything their children ask. There are good arguments against
<em>always</em> giving someone what they desire.</p>
<p>I don’t want to become a simple wanting-thing, that never has to plan
or act or think.</p>
<p>But clearly, there’s <em>some</em> threshold of horror, awful enough
that God will intervene. I remember that being true, when I believed
after the fashion of a child. The God who <em>never</em> intervenes -
<em>that’s</em> an obvious attempt to avoid falsification, to protect a
belief-in-belief. The beliefs of young children really shape their
expectations - they honestly expect to see the dragon in their garage.
They have no reason to imagine a loving God who never acts. No loving
parents, desiring their child to grow up strong and self-reliant, would
let their toddler be run over by a car.</p>
<p>But what if you built a simulated universe? Could you escape the
reach of God? Simulate sentient minds, and torture them? If God’s
watching everywhere, then of course trying to build an unfair world
results in the God intervening - stepping in to modify your transistors.
God is omnipresent. There’s no refuge <em>anywhere</em> for true
horror.</p>
<p>Life is fair.</p>
<p>But suppose you ask the question: <em>Given</em> such-and-such
initial conditions, and <em>given</em> such-and-such rules, what
<em>would</em> be the mathematical result?</p>
<p>Not even God can change the answer to that question.</p>
<p>What does life look like, in this imaginary world, where each step
follows only from its immediate predecessor? Where things only ever
happen, or don’t happen, because of mathematical rules? And where the
rules don’t describe a God that checks over each state? What does it
look like, the world of pure math, beyond the reach of God?</p>
<p>That world wouldn’t be fair. If the initial state contained the seeds
of something that could self-replicate, natural selection might or might
not take place. Complex life might or might not evolve. That life might
or might not become sentient. That world might have the equivalent of
conscious cows, that lacked hands or brains to improve their condition.
Maybe they would be eaten by conscious wolves who never thought that
they were doing wrong, or cared.</p>
<p>If something like humans evolved, then they would suffer from
diseases - not to teach them any lessons, but only because viruses
happened to evolve as well. If the people of that world are happy, or
unhappy, it might have nothing to do with good or bad choices they made.
Nothing to do with free will or lessons learned. In the what-if world,
Genghis Khan can murder a million people, and laugh, and be rich, and
never be punished, and live his life much happier than the average. Who
would prevents it?</p>
<p>And if the Khan tortures people to death, for his own amusement? They
might call out for help, perhaps imagining a God. And if you really
wrote the program, God <em>would</em> intervene, of course. But in the
what-if question, there isn’t any God in the system. The victims will be
saved only if the right cells happen to be 0 or 1. And it’s not likely
that anyone will defy the Khan; if they did, someone would strike them
with a sword, and the sword would disrupt their organs and they would
die, and that would be the end of that.</p>
<p>So the victims die, screaming, and no one helps them. That is the
answer to the what-if question.</p>
<p>…is this world starting to sound familiar?</p>
<p>Could it really be that sentient beings have died, absolutely, for
millions of years…. with no soul and no afterlife… <em>not</em> as any
grand plan of Nature. Not to teach us about the meaning of life. Not
even to teach a profound lesson about what is impossible.</p>
<p>Just dead. Just because.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I believed that the extinction of humanity was not
allowed. And others, who call themselves rationalists, may yet have
things they trust. They might be called “positive-sum games”, or
“democracy”, or “capitalism”, or “technology”, but they’re sacred. They
can’t lead to anything <em>really</em> bad, not without a silver lining.
The unfolding history of Earth can’t ever turn from its positive-sum
trend to a negative-sum trend. Democracies won’t ever legalize torture.
Technology has done so much good, that there can’t possibly be a black
swan that breaks the trend and does more harm than all the good up until
this point.</p>
<p>Anyone listening, who still thinks that being happy counts for more
than anything in life, well, maybe they <em>shouldn’t</em> ponder the
unprotectedness of their existence. Maybe think of it <em>just</em> long
enough to sign up themselves and their family for cryonics, or write a
check to an existential-risk-mitigation agency now and then. Or at least
wear a seatbelt and get health insurance and all those other dreary
necessary things that can destroy your life if you miss that one step…
but aside from that, if you want to be happy, meditating on the
fragility of life isn’t going to help.</p>
<p>But I’m speaking now to those who have something to protect.</p>
<p>What can a twelfth-century peasant do to save themselves from
annihilation? Nothing. Nature’s challenges aren’t always fair. When you
run into a challenge that’s too difficult, you suffer the penalty; when
you run into a lethal penalty, you die. That’s how it is for people, and
it isn’t any different for planets. Someone who wants to dance the
deadly dance with Nature needs to understand what they’re up against:
Absolute, utter, exceptionless neutrality.</p>
<p>And knowing this might not save you. It wouldn’t save a
twelfth-century peasant, even if they knew. If you think that a
rationalist who fully understands the mess they’re in, must be able to
find a way out - well, then you trust rationality. Enough said.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t want to create <em>needless</em> despair, so I will
say a few hopeful words at this point:</p>
<p>If humanity’s future unfolds in the right way, we might be able to
make our future fair(er). We can’t change physics. But we can build some
guardrails, and put down some padding.</p>
<p>Someday, maybe, minds will be sheltered. Children might burn a finger
or lose a toy, but they won’t ever be run over by cars. A
super-intelligence would not be intimidated by a challenge where death
is the price of a single failure. The raw universe wouldn’t seem so
harsh, would be only another problem to be solved.</p>
<p>The problem is that building an adult is itself an adult challenge.
That’s what I finally realized, years ago.</p>
<p>If there is a fair(er) universe, we have to get there starting from
<em>this</em> world - the neutral world, the world of hard concrete with
no padding. The world where challenges are not calibrated to your
skills, and you can die for failing them.</p>
<p>What does a child need to do, to solve an adult problem?</p>
