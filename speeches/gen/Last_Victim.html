<h2 id="by-glen-raphael">By Glen Raphael</h2>
<p>In 1977, Ali Maow Maalin became the last person to be infected with
smallpox in the wild. He was a cook, working at a hospital in Somalia.
He hadn’t gotten vaccinated because the needles looked painful and
frightening.</p>
<p>On October 12th, an outbreak of smallpox was detected. A 6 year old
girl was brought to the hospital. Ali Maow Maalin spent 15 minutes
walking her to a car for quarantine. Two days later, that girl was
dead.</p>
<p>In those 15 minutes, Ali Maalin was infected.</p>
<p>As his fever and rashes set in in the coming weeks, he didn’t report
himself because he didn’t want to be locked away in isolation.</p>
<p>But eventually the disease became unmistakable. And the World Health
Organization set to work containing the last smallpox outbreak. They
identified 161 people that Ali had been in contact with, some living 120
kilometers from town. A total of 50,000 people were vaccinated in the
months following his diagnosis.</p>
<p>And then, we waited.</p>
<p>A year past. A small outbreak at the laboratory, but it was quickly
contained.</p>
<p>We waited.</p>
<p>And two years after Ali walked that girl to the car, we declared
smallpox eradicated. Only a few samples of it were preserved in research
laboratories in the US and Russia.</p>
