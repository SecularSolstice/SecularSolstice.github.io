<p>We just sang “Somebody Will”. Earlier we sang “No one will”. Those of you who notice such things are probably wondering: “Well, will somebody?”</p>
<p>Or as Ray put it last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What’s the deal with the stars?”</p>
<p>The first half of the Solstice is very concrete. We’re talking and singing about real history, real people, real problems that they faced. We delve into messy questions…</p>
<p>…and then the second half of the Solstice doesn’t answer those questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I had an answer I’d just tell you. The plainest thing I can say is: the outside view gives hope. The struggles of the past looked from the inside as dark as our struggles look from the inside today, and people like us overcame them.</p>
<p>It’s a nonconstructive sort of hope, as the mathematicians would say. It doesn’t tell us how we might prevail. All I can say to that is that it will take work.</p>
