<p><em>This is a version of <a

Measured</a>, abridged for speech and delivered at the Bay Area 2019
winter solstice by request of the event organizers. Happy
solstice!</em></p>
<p>When all is said and done, and Nature passes her final judgement, you
will not be measured by the number of moments in which you worked as
hard as you could. You will not be judged by someone rooting around in
your mind to see whether or not you were good. You will not be awarded
extra points for the persuasiveness of the reasons that there was
nothing more you could have done.</p>
<p>You will be measured only by what actually happens, as will we
all.</p>
<p>That is not to say that we’re all aiming for the same outcomes. But
whatever we’re shooting for — personal happiness, a thriving family, a
flourishing future — the type of thing we’re doing is striving to make
the completed history of our universe, from start to finish, good.</p>
<p>Is there a way you want the story of our universe to go? Are some
completed histories better than others? If so, then your task is simple:
act to make our story as good as you can.</p>
<p>While this observation carries little content, I, for one, find it
freeing: Perhaps the path forward is long and difficult. Or perhaps I
can only improve our history in small and personal ways that put barely
a dent in the underlying problems. And no matter what I do, people will
suffer and die tomorrow, and that hurts. But I don’t need to feel guilty
about it. I don’t need to regret my past missteps. I don’t need to
begrudge my personal failings. Because those aren’t useful moves in the
game we’re playing. The game we’re playing is simple: make our story
bright. And all I have to do is take my next step in whatever direction
seems to make our story brightest.</p>
<p>It’s easy to forget this, and focus completely on building
relationships, acquiring skills, or addressing personal shortcomings.
These activities are all well and good, but it’s important to remember
that they are only a means to an end. The real game is not to tick all
the boxes we’ve drawn for ourselves, the real game is to make the future
bright.</p>
<p>This game is horribly imbalanced. People start with wildly different
resources and skills. Chance plays far too large a role. The game is
occasionally heartwarming, but regularly cruel. It tries to convince us
that it’s a player versus player game, and the moment it does, it pits
strangers against strangers, neighbors against neighbors, and friends
against friends. But it’s not a player-vs-player game. This game is
everyone versus the environment, and the stakes are cosmic.</p>
<p>So find allies, find friends, find everything you need to improve
your ability to make our universe-history tell a story you like. And
then fill our future with light.</p>
