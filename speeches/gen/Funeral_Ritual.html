<h1 id="funeral-ritual">Funeral Ritual</h1>

<p>In October 2012 as the first Secular Solstice ceremony was being
planned, Raymond Arnold, the founder of our solstice tradition, was
thinking a lot about death. In the space of three weeks, three of his
friends had lost someone close to them. And it occurred to him that the
rationality community had very little in the way of funeral ritual. Many
of us have been to religious funerals. I have. And as much as I don’t
believe in any of the doctrine, there was something comforting in having
a hundred people join together to say a prayer in unison. What mattered
was the knowledge that the deceased was not alone, that hundreds of
people were connected to them, and to each other. For a few years,
Raymond approached Solstice with this in mind – using it in part to
explore small fragments of funeral ritual. Hopefully, one day, we’d have
some words or deeds we could share together, that felt right. But
funerals are not the time to experiment. It seems like the solution (if
you want an epistemically sound culture with its own traditions) is to
create new ritual in advance, and somehow make it already a part of your
culture by the time someone dies. Among “cultural rationalists”, I’m not
sure how much consensus there is. Some people identify with the far
future. Others do not. Some people see death only to be fought with grim
determination, never acceptance. For some, acceptance is necessary. I
don’t know that there’s a final piece that can work for everyone, but
the single best contender I know of is Eliezer’s Song of Dath Ilan:
<em>Even if the stars should die in heaven</em> <em>Our sins can never
be undone</em> <em>No single death will be forgiven</em> <em>When fades
at last the last lit sun.</em> <em>Then in the cold and silent
black</em> <em>As light and matter end</em> <em>We’ll have ourselves a
last look back</em> <em>And toast an absent friend.</em></p>
