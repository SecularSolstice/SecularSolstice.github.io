<p>There’s a scene in the Lord of the Rings movies (the extended
editions anyway) in which Aragorn kills a messenger from Mordor. In the
book, Aragorn sent the messenger away. The moviemakers probably only
intended to add action to the scene, and had no idea that they had made
Aragorn into a shockingly dishonorable character.</p>
<p>Why don’t you shoot messengers? What does that tradition actually
mean?</p>
<p>Well, in a war, you want to preserve the ability to negotiate for
peace. If you kill a member of the enemy’s army, that puts you closer to
winning the war, and that’s fine. If you kill a messenger, that sends a
message that the enemy can’t safely make treaties with you, and that
means you destroy the means of making peace — both for this war and the
wars to come. It’s much, much more devastating than just killing one
man.</p>
<p>It’s actually not about charity or compassion. It’s about
coordinating a way to not kill each other.</p>
<p>Guest law and not shooting messengers are practical necessities due
to game theory, that ancient peoples traditionally concretized into
virtues like “honor” or “hospitality.” But it’s no longer common
knowledge what they’re for.</p>
<p>In the decades that humanity has lived under the threat of nuclear
war, we’ve developed the assumption that we’re living in a world of
one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemmas rather than repeated games. And we’ve lost
some of the associated social technology. Game theorists do, of course,
know about iterated games, but the original formalization of game theory
was for the application of nuclear war, and the 101-level framing that
most educated laymen hear is often that one-shot is the prototypical
case and repeated games are hard to reason about without computer
simulations.</p>
<p>One of the things about living in what feels like the shadow of the
end of the world — there’s been apocalypse in the zeitgeist since at
least the 1980’s and maybe longer — is that it’s very counterintuitive
to think about a future that might last a long time.</p>
<p>What if we’re not wiped out by an apocalypse? What if humans still
have an advanced civilization in 50 years — albeit one that looks very
different from today’s? What if the people who are young today will live
to grow old? What would it be like to take responsibility for
consequences and second-order effects at the scale of decades?</p>
<p>What would you do differently, if you knew your deeds would echo
through society for five thousand years?</p>
