<p>Welcome (again) to the 2019 Secular Solstice.</p>
<p>We’ve been doing these for a while now. It’s starting to become, not
just a ritual, but a tradition. Which is a very handy thing for rituals
to be.</p>
<p>Those of you who have been to these before, please shout out what
number Solstice this is for you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And those of you who haven’t, please shout “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m so glad you asked.</p>
<p>We are gathered here as a community to mark the longest night of the
year with a ritual that upholds our values.</p>
<p>Since it is the longest <em>night</em> of the year, there’s going to
be a lot of darkness. Sure, we start silly. But I’ll warn you now, it
isn’t staying that way. It is one of our values to face darkness
squarely, rather than retreat into comforting illusion.</p>
<p>Another value, not our most important, but one that’s getting
attention this year, is that we care about the future. So we’ll be
peppering this with past predictions, of which we can say how well they
did. Just something to look forward to.</p>
<p>But I’m not here to enumerate our values. It would take a while, and
<em>telling</em> values makes for lousy art.</p>
<p>I want to talk about us being gathered as a community.</p>
<p>Some of you are very linked in. Your partners, your friends, your
roommates, your favorite writers – all are here in this room or in rooms
like this one in other cities. And some of you aren’t. For some of you,
maybe this is your first meatspace rationalist event. For some of you,
this might be your first contact with some of the ideas we’re touching
on tonight. (If so, this isn’t going to be a very good introduction,
being optimized for emotion rather than clarity. But you’ll have plenty
of opportunity to research later, and I have confidence in you.)</p>
<p>I only want to gently nudge you towards thinking of yourself as one
of us. Such things shouldn’t be rushed. Eventually you will know whether
you are or not.</p>
<p>But I do want you to feel welcome. Even if you’re confused. We’re all
confused, one way or another.</p>
<p>And I do want you to be a part of things tonight. Tonight isn’t about
those of us on stage doing things to you or for you. It’s about everyone
in this room doing things together.</p>
<p>So I ask you to take the rest of the evening seriously. When it’s
silly, take the silliness seriously. If you disagree, disagree
seriously.</p>
<p>And I ask you to sing along. At whatever volume you’re comfortable
with – even if that’s a whisper.</p>
<p>And I ask you not to applaud. Applause is a custom from performances,
not rituals. Also, you’re active participants, so you’d be applauding
yourself. And that’s just gauche. There’ll be a chance to applaud
individuals at the end when I thank people by name.</p>
<p>That’s enough introduction for now. On with the ritual. Stepping up
the seriousness one small notch.</p>
