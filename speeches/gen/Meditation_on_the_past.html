<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<p>The solstice starts far in the past. We’re about to take a journey
there.</p>
<p>Let’s start small. Who were you yesterday? What were you doing?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, a larger step. Think of who you were a year ago? What have you
learned? How have you changed? Are you the same person now as you were
then?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Further back now. Think of your earliest memories, as far back as you
can remember when you were somehow identifiably you - the personality
core that would carry forward to the present day.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Think of your parents, teachers, or guides. Who were they? Where did
they come from? Did they lead you by example, or were they a cautionary
tale about what not to become? What made them who they were, such that
they led you to become you?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now lets begin to drift farther back. Think of the cultures that
shaped your parents or mentors or peer groups. Did they have religion?
Did they have an intellectual community? Did they come from a culture or
country with a strong set of traditions? What do you know of the
cultures that shaped the people who shaped you?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, think of the earliest stories that shaped those cultures. As far
back as you know. What is the earliest clear memetic seed you can find,
that would one day become the culture that shaped the people who shaped
you in turn?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And now, think of the earliest stories you know of, period. Far and
far and far away back, the first inklings of a dream that humans
breathed into words that echoed across history.</p>
<p>Think of the first human explorers who discovered winter.</p>
<p>Imagine surprise or delight the first time a human being saw
snowflakes. Imagine that surprise turn to worry, as the snowfalls kept
coming.</p>
<p>Think of what it would have been like,</p>
<p>to see the darkness descending,</p>
<p>and to not know why.</p>
