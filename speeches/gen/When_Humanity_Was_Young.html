<h2 id="by-matt-elder">By Matt Elder</h2>
<p>When humanity was young, survival was a steady struggle. We were not
particularly fast, or large, or strong, or agile creatures. To survive,
we’d band together into tribes – to hunt together, to gather food
together, to protect each other from the harsh world.</p>
<p>Imagine being alive in those early days. The world is wild, and
mortally dangerous. Life is uncertain. Your community, the human warmth
of your tribe, is your best promise of survival.</p>
<p>And as we near the longest, darkest night of the year; imagine
knowing that winter was again approaching. That the land was dying
again, as it had the year before, and the year before, and the year
before. That the cold, dark days ahead held the dangers of sickness and
starvation. That those days might just kill you, or your family, or your
tribe.</p>
<p>Imagine wondering why the sun was, again, forsaking you to hungry
days and bitter-cold nights. Why? Have we angered the sun? It is just
tired? Can we, our voices together, entreat with it to come back?</p>
