# Winter Is No Longer A Real Threat
## By Matt Elder

These days, of course, the winter is no longer a real threat. In the past millennia, we’ve learned how to cope with the cold and wet and snow. We construct large, heated buildings. We light our homes to extend the light of day. We haul crops from all over the world so that we can eat all year round. We have cities, and industry, and science. We have transformed human life.


And because of all humanity has created, we now have very different powers, and problems, and responsibilities.
