# Tradeoffs
## By Lincoln Quirk

Well we're here. It's cold. It's dark. And it's the longest night of the year.
We don't know what many of our ancestors thought about the Solstice. Were they
afraid of the harshness of winter to come? Did they let their eyes adjust to
the dark, start to face their truths, like, Is enough grain stored this winter?
Or did they look away, and light a candle, and sing songs, and pray?

Probably both. Tonight, for just a couple of minutes, let's first try to look
at what we'd rather ignore.

Human history is, far too often, a story of suffering *we caused*. Occasionally
we were evil. But usually we thought we were making necessary tradeoffs. We
burned witches alive! Communities, watching mothers and daughters get dragged
from their homes and strapped to the pyre, to save our souls. Young boys, in
the mines breathing glass dust, chipping out black gold, for the good of the
family and nation. And do you know how ancient armies were fed on the move?
Tens of thousands of hungry teenagers, showing up on your doorstep, friend or
foe, leaving only a trail of famine.

And now?

[long pause.]

What necessary tradeoffs are we making today? What are the stories we tell ourselves?

Is it right to keep the desperate out at the border just because they weren't born here?

What of our homeless, our elders, and our mentally ill? Are the existing
institutions the best we can do? Or are we making the choices which allow us to
stop thinking about their suffering?

Do billions of hens really have to be stacked in windowless sheds? We
immobilize mother pigs their whole lives. Is it worth that suffering?

These choices are *ours*.

Here in the dark, maybe we can see a bit more of suffering in the world, if we
choose to look. And yes, the world is vast, and change is hard, and we are
small. But. The darkness will end. The sun will rise. And when it does, are we
still happy with our trade-offs?
