# The Shield of Achilles
## By Wystan Hugh Auden


 She looked over his shoulder    
   For vines and olive trees,    
 Marble well-governed cities    
   And ships upon untamed seas,    
 But there on the shining metal    
   His hands had put instead    
 An artificial wilderness    
   And a sky like lead.    

A plain without a feature, bare and brown,    
   No blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood,    
Nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down,     
   Yet, congregated on its blankness, stood    
   An unintelligible multitude,    
A million eyes, a million boots in line,     
Without expression, waiting for a sign.    

Out of the air a voice without a face    
   Proved by statistics that some cause was just    
In tones as dry and level as the place:    
   No one was cheered and nothing was discussed;    
   Column by column in a cloud of dust    
They marched away enduring a belief    
Whose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief.    

 She looked over his shoulder    
   For ritual pieties,    
 White flower-garlanded heifers,    
   Libation and sacrifice,    
 But there on the shining metal    
   Where the altar should have been,    
 She saw by his flickering forge-light    
   Quite another scene.    

Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot    
   Where bored officials lounged (one cracked a joke)    
And sentries sweated for the day was hot:    
   A crowd of ordinary decent folk    
   Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke    
As three pale figures were led forth and bound    
To three posts driven upright in the ground.    

The mass and majesty of this world, all    
   That carries weight and always weighs the same    
Lay in the hands of others; they were small    
   And could not hope for help and no help came:    
   What their foes like to do was done, their shame    
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride    
And died as men before their bodies died.    

 She looked over his shoulder    
   For athletes at their games,    
 Men and women in a dance    
   Moving their sweet limbs    
 Quick, quick, to music,    
   But there on the shining shield    
 His hands had set no dancing-floor    
   But a weed-choked field.    

A ragged urchin, aimless and alone,     
   Loitered about that vacancy; a bird    
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:    
   That girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,    
   Were axioms to him, who'd never heard    
Of any world where promises were kept,    
Or one could weep because another wept.    

 The thin-lipped armorer,    
   Hephaestos, hobbled away,    
 Thetis of the shining breasts    
   Cried out in dismay    
 At what the god had wrought    
   To please her son, the strong    
 Iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles    
   Who would not live long.
