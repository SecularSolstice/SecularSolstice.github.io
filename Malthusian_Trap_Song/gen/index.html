<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Dawn to dusk, row by row, better make this garden grow<br>
Move your feet with a plow in tow, on a piece of fertile ground<br>
Inch by inch, blow by blow, gonna take these crops you sow,<br>
From the peasants down below, ‘till the wall comes tumbling down<br>
<br>
Pulling weeds and picking stones, chasing dreams and breaking bones<br>
Got no choice but to grow my own ‘cause the winter’s close at hand<br>
Grain for grain, drought and pain, find my way through nature’s chain<br>
Tune my body and my brain to competition’s demand.<br>
<br>
Plant those rows straight and long, thicker than with prayer and song.<br>
Emperors will make you strong if your skillset’s very rare.<br>
Old crow watching hungrily, from his perch in yonder tree.<br>
In my garden I’m as free as that feathered thief up there.<br>
</p>
