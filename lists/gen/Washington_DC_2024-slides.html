  "And it's time they heard us knocking on the roof of Satan's dwellin',\n",
  "But we'll get artesian water if we cave the roof of hell in-\n",
  "Oh we'll get artesian water deeper down.\n",
  "But it's hark! the whistle's blowing with a wild, exultant blast,\n",
  "And the boys are madly cheering, for they've struck the flow at last:\n",

  "It is bringing hope and comfort to the thirsty land again.\n",
