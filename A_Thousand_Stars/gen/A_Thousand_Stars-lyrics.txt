A thousand stars erect a shrine
of wordless worlds embracing night.
A candle blooms and spreads its shine
and fills our hearts with such delight.

Within its silence we rejoice,
enraptured by this blissful light,
as if this shrine could have a voice
that rings throughout this solstice night.

From now the darkness falls away
for we have lit this light of ours.
Into next years it shows our way
on through these silent, starlit hours.
